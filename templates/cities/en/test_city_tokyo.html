    To everyone who clicked on this page, let me guess what you’re thinking. “Wait, I thought this was the ‘World in Twelve’? Wouldn’t Tokyo make it 13 cities?”
    <br><br>
    (…Was I correct? What? You were thinking “Man that bacon cheese burger I had last night. Mmmmmm. But I should have added avocado...” ? Oh. I guess I was a little off then, huh. Sorry about that.)
    <br><br>
    Anyway, to answer the question I posed on myself, yes, Tokyo would make it 13 cities. But if you notice, Tokyo is not listed in the city page, is located in the upper right hand of your screen if you’re on the computer, and has the words “TEST CITY” next to it. So it’s a little different.  Let me explain.

   What is “lean,” you say? The concept originally derives from the construction lines at Toyota Motors with its innovative multi-directional checks and balances system. The entrepreneur Eric Ries applied this concept to venture start-ups in his book, “Lean Startup,” and it became an immensely popular way to create new services, products, and companies. Before the introduction of “lean,” when a company would create a product or service, they would put the final version out for distribution and retail. Because of this, it was very difficult for the companies to improve and expand on the product or service, since it was already finished. However, in the “lean” model, the company puts the product or service out for use before it is finished. This way, users can test the product or service and give feedback. The company can learn from the feedback, and improve their product. Since the product or service has gone through numerous tests and fixes, when it is finally complete, it is a much better product then it would have been. You can learn more at:<a

    So, I wanted to make <i>The World in Twelve</i> a “lean” project. I had various reasons for this, One was, although I had chosen 12 sub-projects to conduct, I didn’t know if any of them were realistically possible. Or even if they were possible, were they interesting?? Other than music, I had no background in the production side of any other forms of media. However, many of the sub-projects required basic levels of photography, filming, and editing. Which meant I needed a few test runs. I needed to make a basic template for many of the sub-projects before I left Japan so I could at least certify a certain level of quality. </p>

    <p>Also, I thought the test runs of each sub-project would be evidence that I was actually true to my word. If I just appear in front of people as a foreigner and ask for help, I believe most people would be a bit suspicious. But if I have proof that I am conducting this project in a professional, competent manner, people will be more willing to help.
    <br>
      So “TEST CITY: Tokyo” was born.  Since it is a test city, I will be spending more than one month to conduct all the sub-projects. Also, the number of people engaging in one sub-project, or the sub-project itself might change. But it’s all part of the “lean” concept, so it’s ok. I will be uploading sub-projects in their early stages, and hope to receive feedback so I can improve on them.  
      <br>
      So it would be great if I could receive feedback! (with words that don’t hurt too much haha)
