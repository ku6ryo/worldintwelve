Why Tokyo? Technically, “why” is not the correct usage or word choice in this case. Tokyo isn’t one of the cities chosen for the project, and I explained why I am using it as a “lean” city above. So there really isn’t a “why” aspect to Tokyo. Also, I’ve now lived in Tokyo for 5 years, and it’s becoming very difficult to look at the city objectively. But I do want to talk about Tokyo. And to do this, I’m going to do some soul searching, return to my origins, and do my best tackling the question “Why, Tokyo?”
<br><br>
Tokyo is an incredible city. If I were to list all the incredible aspects of Tokyo, you’d be reading this paragraph for half a day. Tokyo has opened so many new doors for me, and given me so much, I really wouldn’t know where to start. But if I had to choose one thing, it would be the freedom it gave me as a teenager. Being a cynical, sarcastic  adolescent, the endless cycle of high school life was slowly killing me on the inside, day by day. The only thing that revived me and kept me going was visiting Tokyo every summer, and experiencing the freedom it presented me. This was kind of ironic, coming from a boy being born and raised in the supposed “Land of the Free”, but compared to the American suburbia which required a car and a driver’s license to do anything, Tokyo was paradise. Basic knowledge of the public transportation system and a little bit of courage could take you anywhere. You could become anything.

Endless energy and a desire to have fun was a stimulating concoction brewing in the already restless teenage me. When you added the spice of “freedom” to this mix, the possibilities became endless. Everyday my friends and I would chug down this elixir, and set off towards a new adventure. Riding on trains, buying junk food at the convenience stores, eating out at restaurants, wasting time at game centers, singing karaoke--all the stuff that was an ordinary part of daily life for the local residents were fresh and exciting for us. However, the most fun came from emulating the crazy Japanese variety shows we saw on TV. We would conduct our improvised games in the streets and stores of Tokyo, uncaring of rules or surroundings, living in the moment. Looking back now, I realize these were all just childish acts done by kids unaware of repercussions, but they are also the pinnacle of all the “fun” memories I’ve had in my life. When I’m an old geezer sitting in my rocking chair, on the porch, staring out at the sunset, these are the memories I will be reminiscing about.

Two of my favorite sensations are the sense of freedom and nostalgia. If they sold these sensations on Amazon, I would be broke. And overdosed. The memory of getting off the plane and heading out towards Tokyo those summers is one of the few that maximizes both sensations. It goes like this: After the plane touches down at Narita International Airport, and you step out, your senses are immediately assaulted and jolted awake. The glaring summer sun burns your eyes. The jet fuel stings your nostrils. The smoldering heat and humidity engulf you like a blanket. Having been capsuled in recycled air for the past 10 hours, this new environment, where just pulling your suitcase builds sweat on your forehead--you can’t help but start getting excited. You can feel it on your fingertips. Adventure is near.

Riding on the train towards Tokyo, the sun starts setting on the surrounding farmland. Slowly, city lights start to appear. The school girl who just finished her club activities, the “salaryman” who luckily got off work early, the young man rocking out on his headphones--all are heading home, or heading out, living their daily lives. I look around, rub my eyes sleepy from jet lag, and stare at an advertisement that just screams “JAPANESE.”  The sensation starts building me. I have arrived. Who knows what’s going to happen this year. The only thing I can say for sure is that <I>something</I> will happen, and it’s going to be awesome. Summer vacation is here. 
<br><br>
I don’t know if its because I’ve been in Japan for so long, or because I’ve grown older (probably both), but I never feel that sensation anymore when “returning” from the United States. That might be one of my subconscious reasons for conducting the “World in Twelve”, and to answer the original question I posed in the beginning, the reason I am using Tokyo as a test city.  So I can retrieve that sensation, find that new light in this incredible city, and Tokyo will again be the destination for adventure.
