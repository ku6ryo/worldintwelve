    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in Barcelona: 2.5<br>

    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
   Place: We are in a square in Gracia which is a very Catalan neighborhood in Barcelona, and lots of local people just spending their afternoon. Some parents who took their children out of the school for a while to be with them. And grab a beer or a coffee. So it’s a very chill environment to be in on a Monday afternoon.

 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/barcelona/twelve_questions/maria/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Well, I have many places I’d like to go in the world, because I love travelling very much. So it is kind of hard to pick one specific place when there are many places I would want to go. But maybe I would just take this money and go do a backpacking trip in South America, because I’m 28 now. Almost 30, and I feel I don’t know enough of my own continent. I’ve been travelling here in Europe since I was a teenager. To the US… and I’ve been to many European and American cities. And here’s your churros. (Both laugh) And I don’t think I know Latin and South America enough. So maybe I would just get this money, and do a big backpacking trip across Chile, Peru, Ecuador, or every place in South America. It could be done within this budget and money.
<br><br>
>>>Sounds good. I think you basically explained everything. Getting to know your roots. All right. You know,  you can speak Spanish so you can go everywhere. 
<br><br>
Exactly, right? And I think one of the most special things about them, is I’ve been to many different placed in the world, but the people with whom I’m most connected were always the Latin people because they have so much warmth in their hearts. And they have this instant energy to share with you. They’re not suspicious of what you can bring to their life. They’re just open to have that. So I have many, many good friends in South America, so I think it’s more than necessary to know what are the places and the environments they came from.



 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Okay. Well, I don’t know why exactly but I feel like very, very much connected to Africa somehow. I don’t know if it’s because we have a lot of African culture in Brazil, and we have a lot of heritage from African tradition. And also their way of treating people with very… respect and this… I think one of the most amazing things I admire in their culture is their ability to think as a whole. Not thinking in this individualist mindset where there is me, and the things that I need. They always think there’s we and that’s what we need as a group, as a people that are connected with each other, and we depend on each other every time. And I think in Western societies, we are constantly losing the ability to put ourselves in different places of other people. And I think this is something they really have to teach us, and I would love to be there sometime, and feel this energy in a more close way.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I think one thing that represents a lot of Spanish cultures, is this very thing we’re having here. Today is Monday. It’s 4 in the afternoon. Supposedly, people should be in the office, working, but you see a lot of regular folks, not only tourists or children. They’re here just having a coffee or having a beer at the square and getting to see their friends before their work shift. So I think one thing is very nice about Spain and Barcelona, apart from places or things specifically, is their ability to take a good advantage of their time, and their experiences in time. They have a very good lifestyle. Being able to be in the square and to see their kids in a quick break from work, to catch up with a friend that you don’t see in a while. Some things in our crazy routines of hard workers, we lose touch, and I think Spain somehow manages to keep their attention to the basic stuff. What you were saying, to be with your family and spending time with people you like, and seeing the magic in small things. Like small experiences and small gatherings, and I think this is one very, very bold feature of Barcelona. Knowing how to take a good advantage of life, and the season, and the people and the experiences you can have.

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
Okay. I have interesting remarks on both. [Regarding to both Catalan and Brazilian flag] (laughs) I think the Catalan flag, I wouldn’t change it.
<br><br>
>>>You wouldn’t? 
<br><br>
I wouldn’t. Because I wouldn’t have the balls to do it. (laughs) Because people here are so serious and committed about this independence, that I think that redesigning or touching any feature would be a huge deal for them. Because this is a very serious part of identity for them. Those striped red and yellow banner. So, for Catalan flag, I would leave just the way it is because I wouldn’t have to get more conflict with that they already have. And for the Brazilian flag, I really, really like the Brazilian flag.
<br><br>
>>>You like me wearing green, so. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Yes! I like the colors. I don’t know if you’re familiar with the colors meaning? Yeah, the blue for the sea. The green for the forest and all of that. And I also think that the shape itself of the Brazilian flag. They’re very pragmatic. They’re not just like every other banner with stripes or squares. It’s like [speaks Portuguese]. How do you say that?  
<br><br>
>>>Like a diamond shape?
<br><br>
Yeah, diamond shape! You don’t see this very much. This circle in the middle. So I think this is a flag that you instantly recognize, so in the design and marketing side, this is a very good feature. Or one design item is to be easily recognized. But at the same time, I’m very, very bothered by what is written. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Yes, yes. 
<br><br>
In the stripe that says in Portuguese "Order and Progress". And this is what really doesn’t happen at all in Brazil. Especially for the first one, “order”. That’s completely wrong. Brazil is a huge mess. So maybe this order thing is just a hope. Something that they really want their future, but I don’t think it’s connected for our ideals. So maybe, I don’t know, love and progress. (Leo laughs) Or union and progress. Or I don’t know. Worrying about others, and for anything that reflects more of personality like warmth and progress, than order because order is not about Brazil. It’s about other places. Not us.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean <br>
Ah, nice. The ocean is the stomach of the world. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Is the what of the word?
<br><br>
The stomach!
<br><br>
>>>Interesting!!
<br><br>
Yes!! We heard this. Me and my friends, we heard this from the father of a friend who really loves the ocean. And he has a boat and he has a house on the beach shore, and he always says that to us. That the ocean is the only thing that can chew everything. Because it is, right? The oceans can even melt the rocks. So the ocean is the stomach of the world.
<br><br>
>>>That’s so cool.
<br><br>
It’s the thing, it’s the place where you can drag all energies and give them back in another way. So it’s like a very bold and powerful agent of our environment.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br> 
The sun. “Here comes the sun. Da, na, na, na”. (singing) You said I could sing!
<br><br>
>>>>I’m just saying what song is that?
<br><br>
Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles. I just learned how to play the riff on the ukulele yesterday.  (Both laugh) That’s why I’m singing it.  “Everything is alright!” And it is true because the sun is the source of everything we have. So it’s heat. It’s life. It’s everything. So I think people who don’t live in the sun, they’re sadder, and it is a fact.
<br><br>
>>>Welcome to my hometown, Portland OR. (Maria laughs)
<br><br>
You know those places that you wake up and it’s always this white sky? Every day is the white sky? It must be so depressing. You don’t get to feel warm and I think sun is really necessary for you to feel better, even though you don’t like heat, or even though you’re a cold mountain, introvert person. I think everyone needs the sun to feel better. The body is in within their inner selves. Even if it’s in a very discreet way, I think sun is our basic energy.
<br><br>

—Death<br>
[Does hand gesture]
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) What is that? Is that hang loose? 
<br><br>
That’s Death metal!!! 
<br><br>
>>>Death metal!! Okay.
<br><br>
Well, death. What is death? I love poetry. I read poetry lots and this is a very common subject for all writers and poets, and it is our greatest fear. And the thing that we can’t completely understand because we don’t get an idea what is it like to be dead? So I don’t have a clear idea of religion or spirituality at this point in my life. I know I’m almost turning 30, but I don’t think that the experiences I have so far were enough to determine which path I should follow spiritually. So I don’t have any religion for my basis. 
<br><br>
I was raised in a very Catholic country, and right now, Brazil is a little bit more evangelic as well. But I was born in this environment with all this mixing religions. African religions, Spiritism, and Catholic church.  Maybe this is why I grew up with so many different inputs. I didn’t get to choose one specific religion, and I don’t know if it’s too harsh to say this to your video but I don’t believe in God, or life after death or anything like this. I don’t have any specific religion because I believe they are all based in dogmas and old-fashioned concepts. They just don’t translate what human essence is, and what we really feel towards the others. There’s so many prejudices and so many mean things that are still done in the name of religion. Even Pope Francis said recently that in the history of humanity, most of the lives that were taken were in the name of God. So what is God in the end? Is he killing or is he making people live? 
<br><br>
So my thoughts about death, they’re very mixed up. I’ve always seen death like this distant event until I had it in my life with my dad, which was a very, very difficult experience. Because when he was very sick and ill, in the end, I was hoping that in the end… when you get almost no hope, you feel like maybe I can try the religion. Like your last resort. I have to have something to believe in, to have my heart a little bit more comfortable. So I kind of looked for some answers at that time, but even so, I didn’t feel like I was getting what I needed to hear, because I always thought a lot and I always questioned a lot of things, and I was always interested in science, so I will never take that anything people say to me as a truth. I would always doubt and question. So by that time, when my father was seriously ill and almost dying, I saw myself questioning like, “Hey. Are you really not a believer? If you don’t believe, what are you sticking to in such a hard moment?” 
<br><br>
And that’s when I understood what religion is to most people. It’s some sort of comfort, of some sort of spiritual resort for you to be in when you have no faith and you don’t believe anything, and you think everything will be wrong, you just stick to religion because it’s the only thing you have. So I sort of tried to do that. I search and I was praying for my dad to believe or anything but of course, it didn’t work, because that’s how life is. So I just got back to my atheist position again, where I think there’s no God. There’s no one judging what you’re doing, and what you’re not. And I just believe that we have to do our best. People spread love, and spread good messages, and be kind and do not treat people badly because everybody has feelings. And this is it. I don’t need religion or anything to practice some of the Christian ideals. So death, it’s our only certainty in life. Nothing happens anything afterwards, in my opinion. And meanwhile, while it doesn’t happen to us, let’s just have lots of fun. 



 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Okay. Well future is a thing that I always think like in a daily basis of many things. What are we doing with our lives? Is this the right thing to do? Should I take this project because it’s affecting other places? So I think I’m a little pessimistic about the future. But I don’t want to get too depressed talk about this, because whenever I start talking about this, it’s just sad. There are so many fucked up things happening on the planet right. So much inequality, and there’s so many people who are suffering for the other one’s comfort sake and commodity sake. People just live their lives. 
<br><br>
Here, you actually see a little bit homeless people, poor people, refugees. When you live in a country like Brazil or in South America, you’re more exposed to the poverty in a more direct way. So it is very, very impressive and shocking to see how poor people are ignored by society. You’re passing through the street and there’s this guy over there and he’s starving. And you’re looking at him, but just pass because you gotta go to the drug store, go to work and get your life going. But there’s some people here who are suffering. He could be your cousin or your dad. Like your shirt, it’s just purely coincidence that we’re here. [Referring to Leo’s T-shirt with the print “It was purely by chance you were born here”] And I’m not related to him. 
<br><br>
So I think one thing that is really missing in humanity right now is sympathy. The ability of putting yourself in someone’s place. Someone else’s shoes. So I think our future might be a little doomed, because the egos are taking over. The egos are prevailing over the ecosystem, and I don’t think we have a very limited path if we don’t do a very significant change. Like right now or in the next five, ten, or 15 years. I think some bold changes have to happen, not only in sustainable projects or the environment but mainly regarding our behavior, and our attitude towards people. I think we have to be more human.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The most important thing. I won’t say “be happy!!” because tacky, right? And what is happiness? You know? Such a subjective concept. I think the most important people thing…(Thinking)… I think we don’t take anything from this life, right? And since I don’t believe in life after death, or magical stuff or anything, you have to believe in what you have in here. You know? This connection I have with you now, and people I like and people I love, so I think in the end, what matters is not what you get. It’s not what you’re told. It’s what you feel. So I think maybe most. I don’t know. So maybe the most important thing for me, must sound a little cliché as well but being loved and being good to people, and treating people well. Just that and having significant connections and deep connections with people. Not being plain, and just staying in superficial layers. Just having important and significant relationships with people.


</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
And have a good sense of humor because if you don’t have a good sense of humor in this life, you’re screwed because life can be pretty annoying and shitty sometimes. So you have to have a positive attitude towards everything. So what I look for in a partner is someone that has this positive attitude towards life, and towards experiences. Someone that sees life in a very light way. Not in this material way, like gathering and accumulating stuff. And light-hearted, free. Free will. The person that I would like to be with should be able to live anywhere, and being open to every kind of experience because that’s how I feel like right now. I feel like I could be anywhere, and I could meet many different people. So I have to have a partner who would be able to share these sort of things with me. So basically… and he must have a Ferrari as well! (Both laugh) No, no, this is it.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/barcelona/twelve_questions/maria/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: No. Never.<br>
Children:  Well, this has to do with another question, which is what do you think about the future? And whenever I’m getting into this age, I’m 28 now, and I’m being confronted with pictures. All of my friends having babies, and getting married and all these key frame moments in their life where they’re making these big changes. And I’m very happy for them but at the same time, I don’t feel connected to this idea. This traditional idea and motto. Getting married, making this expensive party, then having a child, putting a child in a private school, then getting your nanny to take care of the child for the whole day, then you work your ass for 12 or 14 hours, and then when you get home, your child is so tired from spending the whole day doing activities, you just say “okay, night night”. And then there’s another day when you don’t connect with anything or anything else. Your child, your home, your partner. Anything. So I believe some of these traditional models… they’re fake and hypocritical and I don’t want to follow them. And so by this, this means I won’t have a traditional marriage or maybe I don’t have children, and this is okay. 
<br><br>
I see it in a very natural way. Instead of thinking oh, “I want to have a child because I want a pretty little creature with my face on it”. I don’t want this. I’m pretty aware from having a child, I’m having a human being which I have to pass values, and beliefs, and I have to be fair and provide a very good life quality. So whenever I think about kids, I think about all of this serious stuff and values and… I think about the future. I think about our planet. How it’s developing the situation right now. Will it be a good environment for your children or will they be fighting for water or resources? I think this is the basic thing that people should think, about but instead you’re only worrying about putting cute clothes on them and cute pictures on Instagram or Facebook. 
<br><br>
So… I don’t have a clear answer for you right now about kids, but it has to do with the future. If I see we are turning into a brighter future, with more human practices, and better sources of energy, better use of our planet, maybe it’s a good place to raise a kid. But if it’s turning into this dark thing it might turn into, I don’t want to. So it’s a situation that depends.

    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Sometimes….
<br><br>
>>>Sometimes? 
<br><br>
Sometimes, I feel like I’m still dreaming. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh. (Maria laughs) That’s actually a pretty cool way of interpreting it. But you can use other senses, other feelings, whatever.
<br><br>
The first thing I would like to see when I wake up? Well, I have problems waking up. (Leo laughs) I’m a very night, how do you say that? Nocturn?
<br><br>
>>>Nocturnal.
<br><br>
Nocturnal person. I feel like all of my ideas, creativity, and energies, they are flowing way much more in the dawn or late hours. So mornings…well also, in my family, I was raised by a journalist, and my father was working doing the newspaper the next day. So he would always get back home at one or two in the morning and we would always wait for him to be together. So I was always used to going to bed super late. And I always had trouble waking up in the morning. So for me, morning time is suffering. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>When I say morning, it doesn’t have to be “morning”. It can be when you wake up. 
<br><br>
Okay. Okay. So, in general, when I wake up, which is morning because I have to work, I like to see something that is really comfy and nice because I’m so pissed by the fact of being awake. (Both laugh) I just wanna see something that makes me happy. So maybe it’s my cat coming closer and wanting to snuggle or cuddle a little bit, that would be the greatest first vision in the morning. Just to be a little bit like nothing much, or doing much, just like animal or instinctive stuff. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>What about before you go to sleep?
<br><br>
Oh, nice. Well, since I’ve been used to going to sleep very late, I’m very used to go to sleep after working. So I always go to sleep after seeing so many different types of images. I mean I’ve been seeing fish for the last months because of projects.
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) Your projects.
<br><br>
But beforehand, I was working, with shadows in a theater, like in this creepy opera. (Leo laughs) So I have the most diverse type of images before sleeping because, in general, I’m working. So it’s kind of funny because they also affect my dreams, and they generate these weird dreams because they’re some sort of mash-up of all the things I’ve seen in the day or in the week. So it’s basically creative stuff. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Hm. Interesting. So I guess that would be so basically, you’re seeing now. 
<br><br>
Yes.
<br><br>
>>>Is that what  you want to see or just what you see? Is that an ideal thing to see?
<br><br>
An ideal, oh, okay. Well, I kind of like to see these kind of things. Colorful images and… because when I close my eyes, I keep them in my mind. Colorful shapes and moments and flows. So maybe I can get new ideas and sort of make them interact in different ways that I haven’t imagined before. I do believe dreams are very, very powerful expressions of our subconsciousness. So I think it’s nice to be exposed by beautiful images.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/barcelona/twelve_questions/maria/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Okay. I have passion for the little things. Since I’ve seen Amelise. You know? Amelise, the movie [Reffering to Le Fabuleux Destin d’Amelie Poulain], I got very inspired. And I felt very connected that in our daily life, we are not exposed to big things. We’re just working on the regular basis, so I think we should be able to develop this ability of seeing happiness in small events and small stuff happens in your life. For example, when you’re walking on the street, and a random stranger does you a favor, or talks to you something that makes you think or maybe someone gives you their place on the line. So I’m very captivated by small things that happen in our daily basis life. But talking about uber happiest moments. I always like to recognize happy moments of our lives because it’s important. Because we are always so whining and complaining and wanting things so when we actually get happy moments, I think it’s something we should be proud of to actually recognize. So I have this weird mania of making lists. I do lots of lists. Many different things. Some are more abstract, and some are more pragmatic. So one of these lists that I have is that from happy or special days I had in my life. So I have many of them. I don’t know if you want me to share one.
<br><br>
>>>That’s interesting.
<br><br>
Yeah? I can look up here. 
<br><br>
>>>We can do it later though. If you’d like to.
<br><br>
I could tell you one. For example, it’s very silly. One of the episodes, me and my sister, we were about to move to a new house in Baja [area of Rio] and this house had an… what’s this? An opera singer? [Referring to a girl screaming in the background] (Both laugh) Wow. So the house had a pool. So we were very, very excited because Rio is hot as hell, and we had a pool in our house! So it’s the coolest thing. We could invite our friends to have barbecue and all of that so we were super excited. And about to move to that place but the place was all empty because we’re in this moving transitional period. So actually I was with my car. She was in the university. And so I got there, and I kidnapped her from the class. She was supposed to go to the class, and I said hey, let’s go to our new house. Let’s get some bikinis. It’s empty but we can buy some food, and be there celebrating our pool. So… I kidnapped her from the college, and we got our bikinis, and then we were in the pool of our new house that we wanted so much, and we were dancing, making silly choreographies. And it was so hot and we were eating some sort of chocolate, and our mouths were all very covered with melted chocolate and we were dancing happy in the pool. And that was it. That was a happy moment, you know?
<br><br>
>>>That’s a great happy moment.
<br><br>
Yes! Actually, also my sister, when she was younger, she was very afraid of entering pools. And I was, as an older sister, I was always this pushy person who would say “hey, come on! Don’t be a pussy! Come on in. Enter, enter!” And at this time, we were both adults or, young adults. And she was a little bit reluctant to enter the pool, but right now, since I’m more mature, I’m just respecting her moments and letting her enter whenever she wants. And I feel that she recognizes that, and she feels more comfortable. So this is a small detail, but it says a lot of how our relationship has evolved in the years.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. There’s even that little side story with it. 
<br><br>
Yeah because everything makes part of the special moments, right? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. Wow. Huh. That would be a cool list to look at. Terrifying moments? Scary moments?
<br><br>
Terrifying moments. There was this time when I was a kid, I was six years. And my dad was passionate about soccer and Flamengo.
<br><br>
>>>Flamengo, the futbal team.
<br><br>
Yes.
<br><br>
>>>Yes. I went to see a match at Maracana. 
<br><br>
Yeah? Were you supporting Flamengo?
<br><br>
>>>I had to because that’s who I was going with. It was against Vasco. 
<br><br>
Good boy! No, because I could stop the interview right here. No, I’m just kidding. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>If I was a Fluminense fan right? 
<br><br>
No but you’re a Flamengo, right?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Okay. So we are watching a Flamengo match and it was 1995, I guess and suddenly, the [speaks in Portuguese]. How do you say? 
<br><br>
>>>The crowd.
<br><br>
The crowd? Fell down. 
<br><br>
>>>At the old Maracana! 
<br><br>
Yes the old Maracana. In 1995. I was there. It collapsed. And I was there. I was five or six years old and I just saw people falling.
<br><br>
>>>Holy shit!
<br><br>
Falling, falling. People, people were everywhere. It was crazy. Crazy. So my mom took me by the arm and she rescued me and my dad because she was this humanitarian person. He was helping people getting safe or whatever, and my mom rescued me. And I got the back of my leg all bleeding because I was scratched by one of the chairs that was falling or something. So that was a very terrifying moment.
<br><br>
>>>That is terrifying. How many people died?
<br><br>
I think some people died but many, many people got seriously injured because it was a very huge fall.
<br><br>
>>>I know. I was there, I could tell. There are A LOT of people there.  That would be pretty frightening.
<br><br>
Yes and you see people flying. It’s like a movie. Like a horror movie. It was, even though I was only six, I can still recall because it was a very strong image.

    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Yeah, I love this question. I ask myself all the time. So, when I was a child, I was very introverted and I would spend a lot of time by myself. So I’d be doing these drawings, and writing things, and trying to invent some stuff. I’ve been always very creative. A very creative child. So in the beginning, I had never had a clue of what a designer was. I guess when I was a child, this profession was even in the high… I don’t know. Maybe in the 80s, the design life mentatiliy was still being developed so there wasn’t such thing at that moment. I remember I wanted to do something that had to do with creativity. So I was thinking that I was going to be an inventor in the first place, but then I realized by public opinion, “oh you’re being an inventor? But this is not a profession actually.  Just a thing that crazy people do”. (laughs) And then I had to change my mind a little bit. So I was in doubt between architecture, or something that I could be art related. But basically, I wanted to be an inventor when I was a kid. I would take all these cardboard boxes and reassemble them into airplanes, or cut comic books or magazines and make my own collage or my own storybook then. So I was always into this thing of taking the material you have and transforming into something else.

>>>What would you tell childhood you now?
<br><br>
You are going in the right way, I guess. (laughs) Well, at least I’m doing something that really makes my heart smile. So I think we’re connected somehow. I think I’ve never left being the child I was in the beginning. I’m just this adult, that’s wisest, but I’m pretty much the same, I guess.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool. And finally, what is your dream or goal now?
<br><br>
My dream? Wow. Well my dream is to right now, I recognize already that I do lots of things that I wanted to do before. Like working with art, culture, education. I’ve been able, lately, to do this wide range of projects relating to all kinds of subjects which makes me very happy because I get to learn a lot. So my dream would be that I keep working with different fields, and being able to help different kinds of subjects being depicted in a visual or artistic way. But my actual dream is that I can make a more intense use of this feature, this quality I have which is being able to generate content and visuals or whatever, to actually make some difference in people’s lives. Not doing just TV commercials or ephemeral art installations that will stay for a while and then pass. My dream right now is to use the creative power I have to make some more actual changes in people’s lives.
