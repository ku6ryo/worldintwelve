    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
   Place: Well, it’s still my second time here, but the first time I came here I really liked the food and the atmosphere…The main reason I chose it is probably because it’s really international. It doesn’t just represent Catalunya -it’s like a bit of every country. And it kind of coincides with my background because I’m Japanese, but I’m living here and I’ve lived in a bunch of other countries. So that’s why I chose it.

 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/barcelona/twelve_questions/shoko/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
I would go to Rio de Janeiro.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, very interesting.
<br><br>
Yeah, because actually I was in Brazil last year for the World Cup. I took a ten day vacation, and I worked for one day, but the rest of the time, I was just travelling. So I was in five cities in Brazil and I was in Rio for four days and I really, really liked it. I didn’t have enough time to see the whole city so that’s the main reason why I want to go back. I want to live there and see it in more depth. Also, since I went during the World Cup, there was a lot of security and lots of tourists, so I didn’t really get to see the real Rio. So yeah, I’d love to go back. There’s just so much nature. So many mountains, beaches, lakes…but there’s also a lot of city life, culture and good food too. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s true. Good food? What did you like about the food?
<br><br>
The feijoada. Well, it was a bit heavy. I wouldn’t eat it every day. And lots of fruit juices. 
<br><br>
>>>The juice stands are everywhere. Something I had every day.
<br><br>
And flavors that you never see in Europe, like acerola!.
<br><br>
>>>Starfruit.
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah. And the coconut juices, of course. 
<br><br>
>>>And the mate tea lemonade.
<br><br>
I didn’t try that. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Oh! We’ll talk about this later. You HAVE to try it!! (laughs)
<br><br>
Okay. (laughs)

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Well, I’m in Spain. So it would be kind of boring to say Spain. I would say Holland because I spent four years of my childhood there. I was actually there last week for vacation, and even though it’s been more than 20 years since I last lived there, when I walk along the canals, I feel this connection. It’s like, even if there were some things I’d forgotten about, walking along the canals, I started remembering them. And it’s not a city I would like to live in again, because the food isn’t good, and there aren’t any job opportunities that I’m interested in, but it’s always a place where I feel at home. I wouldn’t mind visiting it every year. It’s not like there’s anyone I know… My friends from my time in Holland are all in different countries now, but still, it’s like a second home to me.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Place? I would say the Camp Nou. 
<br><br>
>>>The FC Barcelona stadium.
<br><br>
Yeah. Well, it really represents Barcelona and I think it’s like the most visited museum in Barcelona.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really? 
<br><br>
Yeah, it attracts more tourists than the Picasso museum. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really? (laughs) I didn’t know that.
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I also think it represents Barcelona because you see lots of tourists but at the same time you see lots of old locals, who have season tickets, who go there every game and it’s a ritual for them. So you see a bit of both and I think that’s kind of what Barcelona’s like.
<br><br>
>>>That’s so true. You’re right.
<br><br>
Yeah, you see lots of tourists but you see also a lot of traditional Catalans in the same place.
<br><br>
>>>The match I went to, I remember, sitting on both sides were this really hardcore old grandfathers who probably have been seeing this for 50 years or something.
<br><br>
And they listen to the radio. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>They’re in a completely different mood than everyone else.
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Do you have a thing?
<br><br>
I would say the flags. The red and yellow flags with the blue star. And maybe pan con tomate too, because it’s the typical Catalan dish. And the Gaudi details that you see everywhere. Those are representative, yeah.

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
I was thinking more of the Japanese flag, but…
<br><br>
>>>You could say that too.
<br><br>
Yeah, well if it were the Japanese flag…well it’s very simple and I’m kind of grateful too because when I was a child, we had to draw the flag of our own country. And it only took me a minute to draw the Japanese flag. It was very easy for me, whereas my friends from Brazil or the US, for example, they would take ages.
<br><br>
>>>All 50 stars.
<br><br>
Yeah. But then at the same time, I feel that Japan is more blue than red. Probably because of the soccer uniform and the fact that it’s surrounded by the ocean. So I think I would maybe add a bit of blue and put the outline of Mt. Fuji or something. But at the same time, I’m pretty satisfied with the current flag. 
<br><br>
>>>What about the Catalan flag?
<br><br>
The Catalan flag? I think it’s fine the way it is and I see so many people in the streets with the Catalan flag, so I guess they’re happy with it too. I wouldn’t change it in any way.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Ocean? Mediterranean Sea. Possibilities. Hope. 
<br><br>
>>>Why possibilities?
<br><br>
I think it’s because whenever I look at the sea, I think of what’s on the other side of it. Especially, for example, if you’re in Japan, you’re on an island. So looking at the sea, you think of all the other countries that are on the other side. Even when I’m here, here in Barceloneta, I think about Italy and all the other countries.

<br><br>
—The Sun <br>
Energy. Vitality. Power. Life. Yeah, I think it’s pretty straightforward. 
<br><br>
>>>Simple stuff.
<br><br>
Yeah. Simple stuff. 
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Darkness. Farewells. Tears. I don’t know, I just imagine the underworld. (Laughs) I think I’ve just read too many Greek myths growing up, but I imagine a river and someone rowing a boat, you know?
<br><br>
>>>Hades and the three headed Cerberus. 
<br><br>
Yeah, exactly. That’s what I imagine. 


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Well, personally, my future is… completely unknown. So… I think it’s something that you have to create yourself. In the end, your life is about making decisions. Every day, you’re making a decision about what to eat, what to wear, where to go. Whether to say yes or no to an appointment or whether to travel, not to travel and in the end, your future is the result of all the decisions you make.  So yeah. I think that’s what my future’s gonna be like. The good thing is that I get to be in charge of making the decisions so if things go well, great, and if things go bad, it’ll be my fault. So in a way, I can control the way I live.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. I don’t really get that viewpoint that much. Do you have something in general? 
<br><br>
Well, until now, for example, coming here to Spain and moving to Barcelona were both my decisions. I could have chosen to go back to Japan. Maybe it would have been better. But in the end, it’s like, you never get to know what would have happened if you had taken the other decision, you know? But as long as you make your own decision, you feel responsible for it, because you don’t want to regret it or you don’t want someone to tell you, “oh, you should have taken the other decision”. Obviously, you will be somehow influenced by the people around you and the environment and everything. But in the end, it’s you who creates your future.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
For me, I think it’s staying motivated. And having passion. Doing what you want to do, being in the place you want to be, but having “the something” that keeps you going forward. Having something that’s “worth it”, to keep you going to the office every day. Staying motivated,  I think, is the most important thing for me.  
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. Is there something underlying that keeps you motivated? 
<br><br>
Well I’ve worked in a few workplaces until now… and I think in the end, if you’re working, you spend at least eight hours a day at work so it’s much more exciting when you’re doing something that you feel passionate about. Otherwise, you wake up in the morning, and you think about going to work but you’re just not motivated enough to go. Whereas, if you have something exciting going on, you’ll always be thinking about it and you’ll have lots of ideas and even in your daily life, you’d be thinking “oh, I could do this, I could do that”. 
<br><br>
>>>So it’s like there’s a work factor to it and there’s also sort of a hope factor to it?
<br><br>
Yeah, exactly.
<br><br>
>>>The possibilities. 
<br><br>
Yeah.

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
I look for someone who I respect, who I admire. Someone who I can learn from. I think it’s important to share the same values about the basic things, but I don’t need that person to share the completely same hobbies. It’s okay if we’re different. As long as we can learn from each other and stimulate each other, and obviously, I look for someone sincere. Someone honest. Someone who I can laugh with, and share stories with, but basically, I think the most important thing is someone I can respect. Someone I can admire.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Yeah. Definitely. Getting married? Yeah. And having children too. I mean, not necessarily in the near future, but it’s something I picture when I imagine my future.
<br><br>
[Second part of the question]
<br><br>
I think… Well…. When I imagine myself with my children, I think I want to raise them the way my parents raised me. I want to travel a lot with them and I want them to be exposed to different cultures. Obviously, get to know their own culture but also get to know people from other countries, so they can understand different perspectives.
<br><br>
My parents also did a lot of outdoor activities, like hiking and camping, and I think I want them to experience that too, because right now in this really modern world, where kids have phones and Internet, you don’t really have contact with nature. I also want them to experience different activities, like I did when I was a child. Play the piano, learn languages, etc…In the end, when you grow up, you’re gonna have to make your own choices. You’re gonna be like, oh, I prefer doing this or I’m better at this.
<br><br>
>>>We’re going back to the choices.
<br><br>
Exactly… I think if you have lots of options, in the end, you can decide what you’re better at. But if you don’t have those options, you’re kind of guided towards one or two things. So if you have more options, you can discover what you’re good at, what you’re not good at. 
<br><br>
>>>Very cool. That’s so true. So basically, opening a lot of doors. And letting the children choose which one you enter.
<br><br>
Yeah. I think, for example, when I was in Japan, they really put a lot of emphasis on doing one thing. Being a specialist. For example, in terms of “bukatsu” [after-school clubs hosted by the school], when I was in high school, I was only allowed to choose one sport and had to do it all year. Whereas in an international school, you have season sports. 
<br><br>
>>> Basically the American way of doing things.
<br><br>
Exactly. And you don’t have to be a specialist… They train you to be good at more than one thing. Unless you wanna be an Olympic athlete or something, it’s better in the long run to try different things.
<br><br>
>>>I mean, even most American Olympic athletes played multiple sports all through high school. 
<br><br>
Exactly.

    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Okay. Well… (thinking)… Right now I live in a flat which is on the mountainside of Barcelona. The house itself is pretty old, but the terrace is amazing, and from there, you have the view of the whole city. You have the Sagrada Familia, and you can even see the sea. I really love that view and luckily, I get to see it every day and every day it’s different. The weather is different, the colors are different, the lights are different…
<br><br>
>>>It’s very interesting to be able to see Barcelona. The farther north you get, the higher you get.
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah and luckily there aren’t skyscrapers like in New York or Tokyo, so you can really see everything. And going to sleep, I like the sound of waves. I’ve stayed in a few hotels right beside the beach, and it’s the most relaxing sound you can listen to while going to sleep.
<br><br>
>>>That’s so true.
<br><br>
And I wouldn’t want to see anything before going to bed. Actually, I need a few minutes to relax in the darkness before going to sleep.
<br><br>
>>>And hear waves.
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>That means you gotta go to very specific places.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 I’ve had happy moments in every chapter of my life. There are too many to list but for example, at university, one of my happiest moments was definitely winning the national championship with my soccer team, in my third and fourth year. Because, in the end, only one team gets to win the nationals. We trained for it the whole year, and it was rewarding in a way because we had to make a lot of sacrifices in order to play soccer. We couldn’t travel, we couldn’t party, we got injured, we got tanned.. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Tanned because of being outside the whole time!! 
<br><br>
Exactly. The horrible tan lines. (laughs) But it was all worth it in the end, and I felt that everything paid off. I’ve had a number of happy moments in Spain too. For example, when I finally got to do interviews that I had spent months trying to achieve. Also, it’s always nice to interview the same person a second time in a different situation.
<br><br>
>>>Because they know you?
<br><br>
Yeah. Also because, for example, one time, I had to interview a coach who had been sacked the week before. He accepted the interview but it was obviously not his best moment. And then this summer, I interviewed him again, and he was coaching his favorite team—the team that he had played in when he was a player.
<br><br>
>>>Who is it?
<br><br>
 Pepe Mel.  He’s the coach of Betis. So yeah, the first interview was a week after he got sacked from Betis and then when I interviewed him again in August, he was coaching in Betis again. So it was like two different situations. And it’s nice meeting the same person in a different situation.
<br><br>
>>>Very interesting.
<br><br>
Yeah and what else? Obviously, well, growing up in different countries, it’s always nice to reunite with a friend in a different city, when you’re older. Even if it’s been 10 years, 20 years since you last saw each other, you just click the moment you see each other.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. I’m glad you have a lot of happy moments. Let’s hope you don’t have as many terrifying moments.
<br><br>
Terrifying moments? I had one two weeks ago when I was arriving to Bilbao by plane. The plane was about to land. I could see the airport. I was going down and suddenly, the plane started going up again into the clouds. And then a minute later, there was an announcement saying there was a technical problem and that they had to retry the landing. It was really scary. The director that was with me started to panic because he’d just gotten married the month before and he thought he was going to die.
<br><br>
>>>Gonna die in the Basque country!! 
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah. But another scary moment was last November, when I woke up and had a dozen messages from my mom saying that my dad had had a heart attack while I was asleep. Luckily, the surgery went well, but it’s so terrifying when there’s distance between you and your family and you have to wait a few seconds before they reply. And especially waking up, to have so many messages and not knowing what’s happening, it’s the scariest feeling. 



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Okay. Well, my childhood dream was to become an author. And then after a few years, when I was in elementary, I wanted to be a teacher. I remember I used to make worksheets for my friends. (laughs) I used to pretend I was a teacher and I’d make them do homework.
<br><br>
>>>And they’re like, “What? More homework?”
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah and I’d invite them to my house and they’d be doing worksheets and stuff, so then I finished that phase.
<br><br>
>>>When did you think you wanted to do things with soccer?
<br><br>
That was when I was in junior high, high school, I think. Yeah, there was this phase when I wanted to be married to a soccer player, then I was like no. (Leo laughs) And then when I was in high school, I wanted to become an interpreter or translator in the sports world. And then in university, I wanted to work in the sports media, as a journalist. And yeah, that’s kind of what I’m doing now. But what would I tell myself? I would tell myself to just listen to your heart. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) It’ll lead you.
<br><br>
Yeah, it’ll lead you. It’s okay to make mistakes. Just try it. If you don’t like it, you can always change. It’s never too late to change the direction. Try new things. Meet lots of people! Make sure you always have the light footwork to take you to places you want to go to, to see new things, go to events, talk to people…Because in the end, well, they say that you have to have luck, but in the end, if you don’t take action, you won’t have luck. You won’t have the opportunity to seize the moment.
<br><br>
>>>Your dream goals now?
<br><br>
Well, I remember the World Cup in Japan when I was in eighth grade. In 2002. I was there as a spectator, but I want to see it happening one more time in Japan while I’m alive. I want to see the World Cup being hosted in Japan, and I want to form part of it, working in it in some way. I don’t know how but –
<br><br>
>>>Well, the Olympics is coming up.
<br><br>
Yeah, the Olympics too but well, in the soccer world, I think more important than the Olympics, is the World Cup. So yeah, I want to take part in bringing the World Cup to Japan in the first place, and during the event, work there. But it’s a long term goal. It’s not anything I hope to accomplish in the next few years, because I mean, they already know where they’re gonna host the next few tournaments, but still.
<br><br>
>>>You got a FIFA connection.
<br><br>
Exactly!
