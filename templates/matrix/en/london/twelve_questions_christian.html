    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：23　Years in London: 23<br>
     <br>  
     Christian was introduced to me through my sister Maya. Christian, an aspiring actor an playwright, showed me around Brick Lane and one of his favourite cafes “Vintage Emporium”. (The place was filled with antique furniture and blasting honky-tonk from an old gramophone; literally one of the coolest cafes I’d ever been to.) It was also fun talking about what its like to be in the theater scene in London, and I learned a lot, from all the indie productions to writing workshops. Plainly put, Christian was just one of those guys you get excited about when thinking about the future. He also gave numerous unique answers, with my favourites being the representations (Q.3), his images (Q.5) where I encountered a first, wake/sleep (Q.10), and his moments (Q.11). So Christian, do make it over to Japan one day, and me and Maya will show you around this time :)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This place that we’re doing it here right now is the Vintage Emporium which is just off Brick Lane. And I think that it’s a cool place because I hang around Brick Lane all the time, and I feel like it is a place that I really feel relaxed. It’s a place that I like to spend my time. </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   Okay, probably go back to Sweden, and just kind of discover a bit more of it because I’ve been to Stockholm twice now, and I’d be nice to kind of see the rest of it. Because I feel like I‘ve seen Sweden, and now maybe I get the picture that everywhere is just like that, and it’s probably not necessarily, so. It’d be nice to do that…maybe discover some of the rest of Scandinavia.
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Okay. Yeah. I would say, probably (Thinking) Wooh! That’s a good one. (Thinking) Probably like…a toss up between…. Yeah. Probably Jamaica.  I think, I’m like half Jamaican, half Guyanese. But Jamaica is a place I’ve actually been to and have seen my relatives who live there and so… probably understand, or feel like I understand Jamaica a bit better I‘d say. Yeah.

</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 That best represents London I think is probably… (Thinking) Probably it’s younger people. 
<br><br>
>>>Ah ! Interesting !
<br><br>
Because I think that in the recent elections, a lot of them have kind of made their voices heard which is something that a lot of the older generations kind of, they said that they didn’t believe it could happen. I know that we still got a lot of people that, that I know that haven’t gotten into that kind of stuff, but I feel that at least a lot, a lot of them are really getting political again, and kind of, I don’t know, being out on the streets and being seen and being heard.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool ! Do you have a place?
<br><br>
A place?  (Thinking) Well, I’d say right now, there’s kind of a lot of stuff happening in the South. There’s kind of Reclaim Brixton movement, and kind of against like, gentrification and stuff like that. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   If I could, I’d  probably just kind of … (Thinking) I don’t know, maybe put a few more  pastel colors in there (Both start laughing) I don’t know get a bit of like… I don’t know kind of go for something crazy and kind of a less…Blue, white, red, because I think a lot of countries have that color in their skin thing. So, yeah. Just kind of go for that !
<br><br>
>>>Pastelly…would it still be red, white, and blue pastel?
<br><br>
It would be different ’cause just to add something a bit new.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean… blue, big, fish, the whale…  (Leo starts Laughing)  and … Yeah. Whales. Aquamarine, Bluff …and that movie about the fish… I can’t remember what it’s called, but  (Thinking) There’s a really good cartoon movie about this boy who becomes a fish, and that’s an image of mine but I really can’t remember the name.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
The sun… heat stroke. (Leo Laughs)… (Thinking)…  Holidays, Spain, Greece. (Leo continues laughing) …back to Jamaica again…(Thinking)… solar flares, sunlight and Scif-fi movies.
<br><br>
>>>Cool ! Wow, I’ve never had a person do this before.  (Christian )
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death. Grim Reaper, bones, graves, churches, cathedrals… prayers, Hail Mary’s.
<br><br>
>>>WOW!! 
<br><br>
That’s just off the top of my head. 


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Okay Well, just kind of for the future, just… I guess my hopes are just kind of we all kind of… keep working and thinking about how to work together in better ways, sort of that kind of stuff . And one thing I heard actually by someone who was talking to me about futurism is that, is that human bodies and  machinery are going to become more closely interlinked. So that might be something that characterizes the future for people in years to come. Yeah, the closing of the gap between man and machine maybe.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Love—Just generally?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah.
<br><br>
Love. To, yeah, to love yourself. To love one’s neighbor like you love yourself. To.. yeah, to show compassion and caring and kind of pass that on.
</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  >>>We talked about girls that a bit today…
<br><br>
(Laughing) Yeah. We did. Yeah. I guess, kind of, compassion. Someone who doesn’t take themselves too seriously and kind of  isn’t too kind of stuck up on… usual gender traits, I guess. And kind of playing a role rather than kind of…  I don’t know, I guess not someone who needs to decide, “Okay, well you’re the guy so you need to do this, and I’m the girl, so  I need to do this,” et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  I’d like it to be a bit more free and  free-thinking I think. Yeah. And so just where you’ve got less expectations, but in the same time, someone who’s willing to discuss those expectations because really, communication, I think, is what makes a good relationship. It’s all about communication. 

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/christian/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 Marriage: Yeah. Yeah. I think in the future.<br>
Children: Yeah. At the moment I think I would, but I don’t know. That‘s, that’s probably…no, I’ll say “Yeah.”
<br><br>
Just again around a lot of people that are supportive and to what they want to do. And kind of to give them their own space like my own parents gave me and kind of they let me know that whatever it was that I particularly wanted to do, they’d support me in that, and they have. And I think that’s really helped me develop as a person, even if we don’t agree on everything. (Laughing) 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Okay. Ideal thing to see would be like… (Thinking) A fresh pair of like theatre tickets on the table (Laughing) and, I’m like, “Oh, how did they get there?” (Laughing)
<br><br>
>>>Sort of like Christmas! 
<br><br>
Right! Or someone’s breaking in and just given them, I don’t know which? (Both laugh)
<br><br>
And the perfect last thing to see which would probably be… (Thinking) …maybe someone I like, yeah, like being able to go to sleep with that person.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Yeah. I guess like the first, the first time that I got told that I could, that someone wanted me to like write a play. I kind of placed that self-belief in me because although it was like the first time I was doing it, it was like you can’t really do it unless someone‘s like, “Yeah, I think you can!” And that kind of changed everything. And, sorry, what’s was the next bit of that?
<br><br>
What was the most terrifying moment?
<br><br>
Terrifying. I think like probably  (Thinking) when I was like really young once, I was like in a, in a swimming class and like experiencing getting water in my lungs for the first time. I think…
<br><br>
>>>Oh! It is a terrible feeling…
<br><br>
Yeah. That feeling for the first time. 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Okay. Yeah. I’d say that my childhood dream was to kind of… I don’t know… was to keep… was kind of, to be like an inventor, or like someone who craves that. Because I used to watch like Wallace and Gromit, like movies and stuff…
<br><br>
>>>Oh yeah, Wallace and Gromit!
<br><br>
…and was really into like Connect Four, and stuff and being able… Not Connect Four, sorry…K’NEX, which is kind of like Legos…
<br><br>
>>>Oh yeah, I remember those. 
<br><br>
…Yeah. Like building stuff and electronic toys and stuff. So I was really interested in, in that although I wouldn’t have probably seen it as a career, although there’s probably something you can do with that.  (Thinking) And yes. I think that’s that’s what wanted to do. What I’d tell my younger self is, “Try to keep doing what you’re doing,” though I kind of tell my young teen self probably, “Less stress! “ Yeah, and kind of more haste, less speed. Then what would I...and what are my dreams now? Now I’m interested in working in film and theatre and currently trying to perfect my writing. So, yeah, so just kind of looking to redraft a certain amount of products or pieces so that I have…I have work that I can send off to theatres and compositions and all that kind of stuff so really kind of get the ball rolling, so I’m not, “Oh, I’m a starving artist .” Yeah, you know.  (Leo laughs) Yeah, soI can actually be in the game
