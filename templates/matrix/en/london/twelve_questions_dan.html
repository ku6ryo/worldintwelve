    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：24　Years in London: 19<br>
     <br>  
     Dan was introduced to me by Kelly. Dan is a photographer and art director, and one of those figures you just want to become friends with—he is insanely talented, hard working, has high aspirations, nice, cool, and fun to be with. I mean, holy hell. I met Dan a few times while in London, and not only did he take time to meet me on his only day off in a few weeks working a double shift, he introduced me to other cool friends (who’ll come up in later 12 Qs :) ), I got to go camera shopping with him (he got his awesome FujiFilm X-T1 I think it was) and the next time we met he even made me burgers at his place. I mean, HOLY HELL!! And just look at all the shows and artists he’s shot…and what he’s overcome to get here…and the mountains he’s climbed, both figuratively and literally… Two words. Mad Respect. That’s all I have. And of course, his answers are great too. They’re all good so its hard to choose recommendations, but if I had to, I’d say his place and thing (Q.3 ), the future (Q.6), marriage and children (Q.9), and his moments (Q.11). But really, they’re all good so you should grab a doughnut or something and take 15 minutes out of your life to read them. Anyhow, Dan, I know I’ll be seeing you again, and come to Japan when you’re free!! Although I know “free” is tough haha.

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  I generally didn't think about it as an interview space, but I knew the background would be all right. And I thought it would be good for picking us up a little bit, because the juices they do here… (Dan makes a smiley face, Leo laughs) Kinda cool. This is like a really special part of London for me, it's where I got my first job. It's just off Carnaby Street, and when I grew up, this was like my favorite spot in London, so. 
 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/dan/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   Is it bad that I've already done this and I'd do it exactly the same again? That's what we were talking about earlier. Last July, I took a month off with about 1,500 pounds. (Laughs) And went to Nepal, climbing. We made friends out there, that I'm still really close with. it was an incredibly tough month. When we got back, it was… it was completely life changing. I've never met so many friendly people who were so motivated, so creative, and so kind… When you meet people traveling, there's a reason why they're out there. There's a thirst to meet people and enjoy themselves and engage with new cultures that are there. So, yeah…—my mom's terrified by the loads of mountains I want to climb out in kind of the Khumbu region of the Himalayas. And there's one called Ama Dablam in which everyone knows that they don't know it's called that because it's the Land Rover and Range Rover's emblem mountain.
<br><br>
>>> Oh, I never knew that!
<br><br>
No one knows that. It's not the highest, but it's technically hard. And it's just in a really beautiful part of the world. And for some reason when you're that high you just see the panorama views. It's really magical. So, yeah, 1,500 pounds.  It's not a very expensive place to go to, so it wouldn't really be a stretch.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 I studied in Scotland, so having spent five years there—the only reason why I moved down is because the creative industry is like 11 months off, one month on because of the Fringe festival. So, for what I personally kind of wanted, to kind of breakthrough, there's a period where you'll always have to go by London or New York, if you're lucky, to Paris. They're creative hubs where you have to kind of… build your craft. And then you can move back. 
<br><br>
>>>Then it can be wherever.
<br><br>
Yeah, so, systematically, I had to move to London, but if, if the world was free, money wasn't a thing and everyone kind of—I don't know. That sounds very socialist. (Laughs) I'd stay in Edinburgh. My girlfriend lives up there so I do get to kind of go home quite a lot. I still consider it to be home.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
My personal feeling from it is the theaters. And…and, I had a theater background when I did a lot of acting during university. And then the first ever internship I did was with a photographer called Peter Dazeley who did a book last year called Unseen London where he went into all these parts of London the public aren’t allowed. Particularly the West-end theaters. And one thing, they have a beautiful story of is how people survived through the wartimes. Where there were bomb shelters, they were entertainment, when there were low periods of morale. And I feel like they really unlock the history of London through everything, what are they called? (Thinking) It’s an odd word, and it begins with B, and I’m gonna forget it. And it’s from the French. Bourgeois! There we go. It kind of came over from France. And that period of people just living lavish lifestyles. And that kinda… and then you have the huge kinda differences between high class and low class. But that was the meeting point in the theater where those barriers dissipated. So, I find that there’s so much cultural melting pot is in the theaters here. It’s a really interesting part of London and I feel like it represents it. Beause there are maybe a 100, 150 theaters around London?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. London has a bunch of theaters.
<br><br>
And they’re mostly being restored, or in the process of. But there are shows every night, eight days, eight shows a week. That’s really cool. There’s one really special musical that I always say people should go to if they have for a short period of time called the Wilton’s Music Hall because it’s the last music hall in London.
<br><br>
>>>Should I go to it?
<br><br>
Yeah. I’ll try and check what gigs are going on there though. I remember there was that one show with Ray Morris.  And The Staves played there recently. Normally, people go there to do special, one-off gigs. It’s just like the most—it looks like it’s in the Titanic, it’s stuck under water. And its got this rusty vibe that is just completely charming and characterful, I love it. And it’s in Shadwell, which, you go there and it sometimes feels like the day after tomorrow, it feels like a really non-sequitur part of London because it hasn’t quite been gentrified yet. But the music hall itself is so cool. And the hipsters haven’t all found it yet. Not that I’m not one of those people sometimes. (Leo laughs) I have as many records as the next one. (Laughs).
<br><br>
<i>[Note: At the time of the release of this interview the hipsters have found it]</i>
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
 I’d definitely have another go!
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really?
<br><br>
My job right now is an art director, so I’d be upset if I couldn’t redesign it to be cooler. Particularly because I feel like flags are very systematic.
<br><br>
>>>Yes.
<br><br>
I wonder if we can kinda, there definitely could be something cooler done with it. I wouldn’t right now, I’d need a couple hours. So, I might not answer the full question. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Will you get back to me?
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>All right, this is the first time because someone says they’re either gonna get back to me now.
<br><br>
I’ll come back with a canvas or something. I will photoshop something or I will paint something. Cyprus has a really beautiful kind of emblematic thing in the middle.
<br><br>
>>>Cyprus does have a really cool flag.
<br><br>
Beautiful. And then Nepal is a freakin’ cool as it’s the only flag in the world that isn’t---
<br><br>
>>>Square!! 
<br><br>
It’s not square! And then you have, I really like Japan’s flag. 
<br><br>
>>>It’s very symbolic. 
<br><br>
But then you have all these ones which are just kind of around the same theme. (Leo laughs). Yeah, Britain is kinda cool because they combined. And they need to have the dragon of Wales in there, and they need to have a bit more Irish in there. Northern Irish in there, so. A bit more color palette.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
First thing that came into my mind is a song by John Butler. I don’t know why, but the visual is him playing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsnFvEQYJPU">“Ocean” in front of a Melbourne audience</a>—I bought the record of it very recently. It’s just like, my flatmate in second year of uni seemed to know it by heart and played it every morning. At that time I didn’t like it as much. (Leo laughs) But it is a really iconic kind of thing in my head.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool.
<br><br>
 And it’s 12 minutes, thirty of him just playing the most mesmerizing kind of song. Not really sure why it means oceans to him, but it does to me. I immediately go like, “oh”.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Don’t see it much around here. (Both laugh) First thing that comes into is, is my prescription for vitamin D medication replacing the lack of sun in my life. (Both laugh)
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 An end of a good run. I don’t think it’s an unhappy thing anymore. I think, people are seeming to be living a lot later. I personally, I’ve had so many close calls with it, with Chrohn’s disease and in kinda like, hospitalizations where… Yeah, for me…you come close, it’s always deeply saddening, but yeah. My image of death isn’t a sad one. I normally find when it comes together, it’s time for celebration and with any luck, it’s a very late period of life.
<br><br>
>>>It’s an end of a good run, then. 
<br><br>
You can still have a great run at 25 or 26.
<br><br>
>>>Hmmm its like the origins of the marathon. That one guy ran all the way from Athens to wherever.
<br><br>
Is it Rhodes or something? He did it twice and died on the second one. [Note: It was from Marathon to Athens]
<br><br>
>>>A very good run. 

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
I think one thing that’s always been in my head on the photography side, if I’m allowed to look at that?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, yeah. You can say whatever you like.
<br><br>
We were talking about earlier how photography is becoming so accessible now that my mentor…So I had one mentor in photography, who is a guy called Pete Dazeley who’s very world renowned fashion and commercial photographer. And he just said “What the hell are you doing? Photography is going to be dead in ten years. I’m packing up my shop now, I’m done! Phones will have royal capabilities”, so, I, yeah. I think one thing about the future I’m worried about is the things that I love doing might become so accessible that they aren’t a thing anymore. But then I’d always argue there has to be an idea behind creative, and that’s not a free trading thing. Not everyone can do that. 
<br><br>
The future itself; I think the internet is as scary as it is exciting. I think that, we were talking about the  bullying side and cyber bullying and teen suicide, and things like that. Increase in depression. That’s worrying me a lot. On the other side of things, I think technological advances in health care are incredible. The fact that robots are doing brain surgery, and… I think that’s the first thing I talked to my dad and then it hasn’t gone much farther than that. But there’s so many things that are incredibly exciting, which are working towards longevity of life. And that for more time, you paint your own canvas. Yeah. My grandpa, it was my grandpa’s 86th birthday last night and he said he felt like when he met my grandma when he was 15 was yesterday. And I was like…actually he then said “a few yesterdays”, and I love the ideas of a few yesterdays ago.
<br><br>
>>> I know the next person to do an interview on, grandpa!
<br><br>
(Laughs) He’s, yeah, and that’s so sharp. He said “I feel robust on my 86th birthday” and…  He’s so sharp, and yeah, the idea of living longer is, is amazing as I feel they just have more and more stories. They’re the most interesting people I’ve ever met. I think the future is in talking to our elders as well.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/dan/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The most important thing for me are people. I really… it’s something I realized a lot is I love having people around. One thing from that trip last July. Meeting people, I love meeting new people. I think it gives me—I really like bouncing off that. There’s never more exciting moment then when you meet someone new that you have stuff in common with. You only can have the world to talk about at that point. Because you have no previous talking points with them. You’ll never have more to say to someone than at the first point you meet them. So meeting new people gives me a lot of confidence base and I really enjoy it.
<br><br>
>>>Thanks for explaining my project for me! (Both laugh)
<br><br>
So that’s, that’s one of the reasons why when Kelly sent me an e-mail quite late, I think it was 1 A.M., I kinda left it a day, because I was like, “did I read that right?” Yeah, meeting new people is really up there. Seeing friends, meeting new people, filling in time with other people. I generally don’t watch a lot of TV, on the other side I don’t read many books, unfortunately. (Leo laughs) I read a lot of…well I fulfil the hipster vibe again, I read a lot of beautiful coffee table-like magazine things. (Leo laughs again) I have one here, hooray! This is like a really limited publication that just talks about photographers around the world called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.readinclovermagazine.com/">“In Clover”</a>. It’s on the second print edition. And it’s just a group of friends who got together and said, “we don’t like watching TV at night, we like reading about other creators and what they’re doing”, and yeah. The most important thing is, I’m just going to say again, leave yourself open to meeting new people and not be afraid to give a bit of yourself to them and them back to you. Your project. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>So true!! Now I can just show your 12 Questions when someone asks why I’m doing this project (Laughs)

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Has to be… it’s changed a lot.  I always used to look for the chase. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow. No one has ever started with, “it changed a lot”.
<br><br>
Oh, no, it’s changed from a period of learning about what I respond well to . Initially it would be… everyone was going for somebody they found really attractive, it was your 15 year old “like oh my God!” And then it kind of went around to “I find it interesting in the chase”. Then I realized no, that’s not right. The right amount of chase is when you guys are really excited about talking to each other all the time. And the chase is learning more about those people. 
<br><br>
>>>You’re a poet.
<br><br>
No! Not in any way. I’m quite romantic and my girlfriend very much is too. [Note: Here, a lady selling an app from some startup interrupts for a minute] So, I was saying, I’m with a girl who is just… It’s the first one I’ve met, someone who’s just so incredibly kind. I find her just really exciting to be with. Because she’s so into acting and theater and really just amazing at it. I do find it incredibly attractive when someone has quite a lot of drive in the creative fields. It also means we already have a good understanding for each other when we’re incredibly busy because those products are kind of consuming at times. But always having someone, that person, making time. Someone who will always make time.
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/dan/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yeah, yeah. 100 percent.<br>
Children: Yeah, I think there’s nothing cooler than having a carbon copy of you and your partner! Like a little version, then you can very loosely curate them hopefully too… just my experience of being around friends who have kids, and they’re wonderful. And it’s probably the biggest blessing if you can have a kid with someone you love.
<br><br>
<Back to original question><br>
I definitely want them to fall on the artistic side if possible. But that’s a really broad world, so that’s cool. My parents were really great and they didn’t pressure me into something. They taught me how to play golf when I was six. (Leo laughs) And my grandma did it wrong. She gave me the, a left handed grip on a right handed club. (Leo laughs again) My dad had to very quickly change that around. (Both laugh) But they really wanted me to pursue that. And then there wasn’t crazy amounts of pressure and they really allowed me to kind of go down a route. So there’s… there just, just the right amount of freedom.
<br><br>
>>>Do you still play golf?
<br><br>
A little bit. Not massively. I used to be pretty good, and then it kind of fell apart. But yeah, I love… I think kids just, they need to be happy through 13 to 18. I think that’s the really difficult thing.
<br><br>
>>>This is a big thing for you, huh.  We’ve been talking about this before, about childhood depression.
<br><br>
It’s because we did, a project with BeatBullying on anti-bullying and cyberbullying and the research kinda, I just found it really kind of… consistently interesting going deeper, deep into it. We managed to make the advert, we got a full cinematic, kind of, film out of a 500 pounds budget. Just pulling in every favor we had across creative arts. We managed to get all of Soho backing us up, the agency ended up being really proud of the work. It was getting people to sign up for a anti-bullying march. It was based off the idea that… it’s the phrase “sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me”. We changed that to “words will hurt me”. So, every time someone gets a text, a bruise appears. Words hurt. They cut through.
<br><br>
>>>Words probably hurt more than sticks and stones in our era.
<br><br>
Yeah… we talked about this before. I think, I think, oh, who was it? I was talking to one of my close friends, Doug. We were saying that the biggest things that can stop bullying is core values, good core values among families and within school years. He said his school environment meant everyone treated each other well because of it … I know we’re going off on a massive tangent (Laughs) But it’s, just doesn’t matter if you are gay or straight, tall, short, fat, thin. Everyone was in it together and they were gonna have a rough time if they weren’t that way. Whether you’re sporty or not, music-y or not, theater-y or not, everyone kind of got on. And I never really thought about it that way. Instead of people— boys talking about the harmful side of bullying, more talking about projecting the core, good values on to big social group. And it’s completely out of line with our ethos to step out of that and that would get you in trouble at that school instead of being kind of you shouldn’t bully, you should promote path.
<br><br>
>>>You’re focusing on the positives instead of the negatives.
<br><br>
In advertising, in our day today, we’re not allowed to put out biased— yeah, there are people who do it. But it’s, it actually de-sensitizes people toward negative messages.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 I think going to bed at night feeling like you have a clean slate. So… normally for me that means I’ve done all my work. Even better for if there’s a day off the next day. I have so many different timelines going in my head. And I… for some reason, I operate so much better when I’ve just got, I just got it ticked all off. Got a clean slate. Going to bed I’ll sleep better. Waking up in the morning, I don’t care, it’s a new day, I’m excited nonetheless. Or if I’m grouchy and moody, that’s something I’ll go deal with. But I normally, when I wake up in the morning, I think a clean room’s good. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Clean room. Interesting.
<br><br>
Actually, I’m going to change that over because you didn’t say where I needed to wake up in the world, so… I wanna open my tent at a music festival. One of my favorite experiences pretty much in life are music festivals.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a good answer.
<br><br>
So, opening up my tent. Although, it’s awkward as f—wait, I can’t swear—
<br><br>
>>>You can swear! (Laughs)
<br><br>
Well, awkward as something when you have to kinda change into new trousers in a tent barely, half your height.
<br><br>
 >>>(Laughs) Especially, you’re a big man.
<br><br>
Yeah, 6’4’’. It causes much hilarity. Opening a tent and just seeing the sun out there, and… yeah. And then knowing that your favorite bands are playing that morning. That’s Glastonbury 2009!! 
<br><br>
>>>It’s better than a clean room
<br><br>
Yeah, much better than clean room! That was a rubbish answer! (Laughs)


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/dan/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
There’s… for some reason there’s a really strong moment where I had a lot of health troubles with Crohn's disease in my last two years of school. So, it really… it also affects my brain, affects my concentration, and I was really worried about getting the predicted grades I need to get into college. For some reason I always remember on results day, it was an electronic thing that went live at 12 in the day and I had my pal from Australia over, Jimmy, and then my mom and my sister in the room. And yeah, I got the grades to get into Edinburgh. I think it was more the anticipation and then the worry that I probably hadn’t come close and that wasn’t necessarily in my hands because my health had been so bad. Then knowing what that lead to and how incredible, and how much it changed my life going to Edinburgh, that was kind of planting the seed for some really awesome times. So that was not only a very happy moment, but facilitates many other happy moments.
<br><br>
>>>Also, the reason than you were there, that’s what started all the photography.
<br><br>
Yeah, so, at the end of, because I had been so unwell, I couldn’t do a lot of sports. So my step mom had taken me to some photography spots around some of the tunnels around Waterloo Station. And me learning… Okay, so action sport might not be possible until my health comes back, but creativity started at that point and then… So, my sports kind of went down and what my experience in creativity started then. But I've done no art school. 
<br><br>
>>>You were majoring in Music History, correct? 
<br><br>
Yeah I changed degree. (Laughs) But yeah, so, happy moment was getting into that uni, that was amazing for me. And then…(thinking)… I'm not very achievement focused—I don't necessarily base happiness off of achievements. Other people say that they’re proud of me but I'd say probably one of my happiest moments was first time getting booked to go on tour by record label. It's really, I told you, the six hour train down to Cornwall. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Yeah (Laughs)
<br><br>
And just being like, “what the fuck?”, no idea what was going to happen. And, so, every time I go on tour I get that feeling of, “I actually really like traveling on my own”. And putting yourselves in those momentary uncomfortable situations always seems to be sink or swim. And you always float because you can’t not. And you gotta be friendly around everyone just naturally. So, yeah. So, the happiest moment of, (laughs), is getting into uni and the first set of tours this year. So, I did, I’ve done three now. I did New York, I did Jack Garrett. Lucy Rose. Actually four. Seafret?
<br><br>
>>>And terrifying moment?
<br><br>
Terrifying moment. I was… I was seven stone and a quarter which is no idea, is that like 45 kilos? And 6’2’’? When I was 15.  From Crohn's disease. I hadn’t been diagnosed yet. And my dad thought I was anorexic. And I was finding it really hard to even eat anything for several months. Then had loads of symptoms come up. And I had to go to hospital for emergency op and I was just like “this is game over. I have enough energy to maybe lift my arm. How… how is this gonna work out?” And I thought I was on my way out because no one knew what was wrong with me. So, that’s me at… that’s 16. (Thinking) So yeah, that was—For me that was terrifying, because I was letting down my dad. Because I didn’t know why I couldn’t eat anything and why it hurt so much. And then he’s a doctor and he didn’t feel like he could diagnose it. And it was, I had to have lots of ops to really kind of get to the crux of it. I still have my treatment every six weeks now. It’s called infliximab. it goes through IV, and yeah, life’s changed since they got me on the right diagnosis and treatments and stuff. So, yeah, it was really— Yeah, scary as, scary as hell!
<br><br>
>>>That’s not fun…
<br><br>
And then I had it again when I was 21 at uni…yeah, I had 18 months out again then. So, I’m not scared of it once it's happened, it’s scary at the very beginning, the “I know what this process is gonna be. I know it’s going to be another seven or eight months until I’m okay again”. It’s really, it’s just frustrating. Particularly in creative, where you’re freelancing quite heavily, you’ll lose contracts and clients. Money doesn’t matter too much, it’s more just getting on with it and getting through. (Laughs)


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Okay. Well, first, when I wanted to be a doctor because my dad is, and my grandpa is, and my uncle is and—
<br><br>
>>>Do you have any siblings?
<br><br>
My brother and sister, my brother works in distribution in games, game consoles.
<br><br>
Is your sister a doctor?
<br><br>
Sister’s a fashion stylist in America. So we’re all very different.
<br><br>
>>>So, no one became the doctor.

No, and my dad has a practice to take over. So...several now! (Laughs) I studied biology and maths and physics up until the end of school in the hope I can keep it going. And chemistry at standard level, and yeah, didn’t want to go into it. But I—then if I to go back to your childhood, and you say “to be a doctor you can’t be like my dad anymore. You can’t just be incredible with your bedside manner, instinctual… and book smart”. He’s incredibly smart, but not in the way you need to be now to be a doctor. He’s… he’s incredibly businesslike, incredible with the medical stuff, obviously, but he’d argue that the courses, the way they teach them now, are academic, and his are more academia mixed in with care. So, I don’t think doctors are being built the same as they used to be. So, my idea of what a doctor is what I idolized my dad was this wonderfully kind gentleman who is incredible in the medical side, but also able to kind of… you can sit next to him in a plane for 24 hours and still wanna talk to him afterward. Incredibly human-type whereas now it’s really driven in the academia side. So, I’d say to the kid me, “change your dream slightly”. (Leo laughs)  Become… I don’t know at all! (Laughs) I think the emphasis on a doctor’s changing. It’s a shame. So, yeah, it’s cynical view for the first time in this interview but (laughs).

>>>What is your dream now?
<br><br>
My dream now is…(thinking)…It’s definitely on the music side. I definitely wanna travel the world with my camera in my hand with my favorite bands. And I’m saying tour documentaries, so both film and photography. People always said to me you can’t necessarily be a very good filmmaker if you’re a photographer, and vice versa, but I just think there is a lot of crucial crossover and a lot of composition. There is something really incredible about people who are wonderful filmmakers who are wonderful photographers as well, because you’re making one frame a second and go into 24 and being able to keep the narrative trackable. So, yeah, I’d love to be able to go around the world, favorite bands. And right now the job that I just moved across into…it facilitates it massively which is awesome. So, so far, I am really happy at the moment because it’s, I’ve been put right on track with what I wanted to do. Because I was, for the… so I’m starting at Sony Music next month. Commissioning music videos, tour videos, sections, and then the photography. And… there aren’t many  roles in that, there are like eight video and photo creatives in the whole building and it’s like seven labels, it’s crazy! So, I feel quite lucky. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>You are! It’s gonna be very cool.
<br><br>
Yeah, and I had… because I went straight into creative out of uni, I never needed a CV. I just needed a portfolio and I was really used to that and it was great. 
<br><br>
>>>You’re whole site is a portfolio!! 
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah. And then having to do a paper one again, I was just like “Ohhhh”. So, right now I’m—I’ve definitely been pushing really hard to get close to that dream. I’m feeling not that very far away, so it’s cool, it’s cool. I’m excited.
