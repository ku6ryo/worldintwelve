    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in London: 20<br>
     <br>  
    Genevieve was introduced to me through Dan. Gen is an illustrator and gave me a tour of her area, currently the trendiest/hippest part of London called Peckham. We went to two bars (along with Dan, as you can see in the pics, and Kelly, from NY joined later too!), one which was on top of a parking lot (whoa, that sounds really American English. Parking Lot lol) where you could see the London skyline, and the other which was hidden beneath a tunnel. Where we drank Pims. Yeah, that’s hipster! Gen was so much fun to talk with, not just because she actually had background living in Tokyo, but just because she has that unique sense of humour and expression of opinions. I mean, just read question number 10. If that doesn’t scream completely original and dually hyper educated, I don’t know what does! Haha. So yeah, all of her answers are great, but if I had to choose along with Q.10, I would say the place/thing (Q.3), the future (Q.6), and the partner (Q.8). So Gen, thanks again for everything (you’re T-Shirt design will be up shortly) and I’ll meet you the next time you come to Japan!!

    <br>
    Place: Right now we’re in a bar called “Bar Story” in Peckham, which is in Southeast London. Southeast London is still one of the few places young people can afford to drink in London, and so I wanted to bring you here!

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   One month…I think I’d go to New York, because I’ve never been. Yeah, it’s been on the top of my list. So I would go to New York and I heard its pretty expensive there, so I’m assuming just existing in New York would eat up all of my money. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you have anything you want to do in New York? 
<br><br>
Um…not really. I think the good thing about cities is that you don’t really have to have an itinerary. You can just walk around and discover the place. So in this dream world where someone just gives me money, I’m hoping they also give me a good friend who is informed and will show me around all the cool places. 

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Japan. So I studied Japanese in university and I lived there for a year and a half. I lived a little bit in Kobe but mostly in Tokyo. And I think that…I think a lot of people think of Japanese people as being cold. But they’re not at all. Their kindness makes them the most sincere people you’d ever meet. And insanely loyal. So…its kind of a hard place to get under the skin of, but once you do, you feel really really at home there. The friends I made in Japan I know I’ll have for the rest of my life. And it’s just a mad place. It surprises you everyday. Yeah, I don’t know anybody who’s lived in Japan and not fallen in love with it. It’s such a strange but charming place. Fascinating. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah most people I know that just visit end up thinking “I have to try living here once in my life!”
<br><br>
Yeah definitely, because you need to figure it out, and its SO weird. I lived there for a year and a half I don’t feel I figured it out. It’s constantly surprising you. Just the way people behave and the things being created. Yeah, very very weird, but very cool place.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I think Deptford Highstreet Market. So I live in Deptford in Lewisham, and there is this market that happens on Saturday, Friday, and one other weekday, but  I can only go on Saturday. It’s like a proper old-school trader’s market—you can get anything there. You can get fish there, you can get stolen TVs there. And there is this one store that only sells batteries and lighters. It’s just a mad place, and the people that run the stalls come from everywhere. There’s Indian traders, African traders, Cockney traders—just, all life is there. And I’m kind of afraid it’s going to be encroached on soon, because sadly London is becoming all posh and gentrified.  But for now, I think the market really represents what London is about, a true mix of loads of hard working people, all doing their shit! </i>

    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
I might make it symmetrical because I don’t know why it isn’t and it kind of ticks me off. So that’s what I’d do. Make it symmetrical.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
It’s that awful but also really nice feeling when a really big wave hits you too hard, and water goes up your nose and all your senses just become “salt water” (laughs). 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Oh that’s not fair because you see, just  this afternoon I was looking at sculptures made by Dale Chihuly. Like the guy in the V&A, he makes the glass blowing sculptures. He did that. And he made this huge sculpture called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.th/search?q=the+sun+dale+chihuly&espv=2&biw=1363&bih=734&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj899yunePJAhULV44KHTPJAzkQ_AUIBigB">“The Sun”</a>. Its a giant glass red ball, and that’s all I can think of (laughs).  
<br><br>
—Death<br>
…(Thinking)…Sorry its kind of dull, but it’s this classic, Death in his black cloak and skull face. 
<br><br>
>>>Like the Grim Reaper? 
<br><br>
That’s the one! The Grim Reaper!

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Quite positive…in an apathetic kind of way. Because I think we’re very arrogant in general. We assume that things we do now will have a significant impact on things that will happen later. But I think…the world is much bigger than we are, and it will keep on doing what it’s doing. So I think its irrelevant whether we’re there, or…what really happens. It just keeps going. That’s why I said optimistic…or rather positive but apathetic (laughs). 




</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/genevieve/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Um…I think yeah, friends and family. I was trying to choose between that and illustration, but I think it has to be friends and family. I’m sure everyone says that but. 

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 >>>I’m assuming “not forcing you to do the laundry?” [referring to a previous boyfriend Genevieve had in Japan]
<br><br>
Yeah! If he’s not asking me to do his laundry, that’s always good (laughs). Um…a sense of humour, obviously. I don’t know if I look for it, but I seem to always end up with just fucking weird blokes. All the guys I’m with are just strange, strange people. So I’m looking for ordinary basically (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>Just a normal guy. 
<br><br>
Yeah, an ordinary man (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>Could you give us an example of someone? Obviously, not naming names (laughs). 
<br><br>
Well, I could talk about anybody, except for the ones I dumped immediately because I realised there was nothing about them I could put in my autobiography. So the last one that I had a long lasting relationship with had four different mattress protectors…? For reasons that are far too dull to explain. They did make logical sense, but it still was still insane. So yeah, that kind of mental…
<br><br>
>>>Mattress protectors? 
<br><br>
Yeah, mattress protectors. The things that you put between the mattress and the sheets? I don’t know the function of them…maybe to keep the mattress clean? But he had four. FOUR! I don’t think I have one. But yeah, that’s an example. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/genevieve/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yes<br>
Children: Yes 
<br><br>
No…well I’m always sort of grateful towards my parents…it probably comes from having lots of siblings.
<br><br>
>>>How many do you have? 
<br><br>
Three brothers, so four of us altogether. So they never really put much pressure on us, or had any particular expectations of us. I think that’s quite nice. So I think that is what sort of let us become what we wanted to be, not being forced to become something like, a concert pianist or something. So I would like to think I’d do the same thing. So my mum, one time I made shoes out of paper, and she would let me wear them out in public. And I would always look back on that and think “now that’s good parenting!” (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>That’s an amazing example. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 I think waking up would be…we once, when I was travelling with friends and went camping, we were just laying outside, we didn’t have a tent. And this storm happened, and it was insane. I am not kidding, it went from nought to sixty (check?). We thought we were going to die—rain lashing, wind howling. We managed to scramble to a little hut, and we waited for the storm to end but we fell asleep. And I remember waking up the next morning with the weirdest feeling. Like the earth was just exhaling, and we all thought “oh! we’re still alive!” It was so dramatic the previous night, and now it just seems so funny. And we were looking out at the ocean, and everything was very still and very calm. 
<br><br>
>>>Where was this? 
<br><br>
This was in Croatia. 
<br><br>
>>>So this would be your ideal? The earth exhaling!?
<br><br>
Yeah, I think its a nice way to wake up, to feel like something new is happening. That everything is ok. 
<br><br>
>>>Ok cool! What about going to sleep? 
<br><br>
Going to sleep…would it be really weird if I said orgasming? I think everybody should “come”, and then go to sleep. 
<br><br>
>>>Come and go to sleep…
<br><br>
Yeah it’s the best way to go to sleep! Every body sleeps better and wakes up fresher. It’s true! (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
>>>This is amazing! One question…is this like literally sexually orgasming, or is it more or a mental state of “orgasm”?
<br><br>
I mean if I could exist in a state of mental orgasm, I’d do that, so let’s say that. 
<br><br>
>>>…You have just introduced me to a new world (Genevieve laughs).

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/genevieve/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Can I say scariest? Yeah, because that would be easier…it would be experiencing the earthquake while in Tokyo. Were you there as well??
<br><br>
>>>No I actually was in the US…
<br><br>
Oh…well it wasn’t actually experiencing the earthquake itself. That was dramatic, not too scary. It was more the day after, when no one really knew what the fuck was going on. That was quite scary. Because I mean you can’t imagine, a whole side of the entire country had been completely destroyed. Like so destroyed that no one knew what really happened because there was no one left to explain. And no one knew what the situation was with the power plants. I’d never been in a situation where “no one knows”. Usually, no matter how scary the situation, someone knows
<br><br>
>>>Anything happy? 
<br><br>
Happiest moment of my life…(thinking)…this is really hard! Can I say the happiest time? 
<br><br>
>>>Of course! 
<br><br>
Umm…(thinking)…I think my happiest times were while living in Japan. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow! After all these years living in London! 
<br><br>
It’s not that I don’t love London. London is amazing, and I’m absolutely in love with London. But I think it has to do with…it was at a time in my life when I hadn’t had a proper job. And I hadn’t been away…well I had lived away for my time in uni, but I hadn’t really seen anything. So there was something really awesome and eye opening about going to and being in a different place and realising that you’re fine. I sort of realized that everything is fine. Even if you’ve got no money, and nothing, shit works out. I think it was very freeing, learning that. It also means I had the most amazing year because I was like “Everything will be fine!!” And that sort of formed the way I have behaved in life generally since then. I’ve made some disastrous mistakes, but in general it makes for a good time (laughs). 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
up and draw pictures because that’s what I loved doing. And I did some awesome things in-between that had nothing to do with drawing pictures. And now that I’m a little bit older I’m like “Yeah, it turns out I really like that, so I’ll do that again.” Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>So what would you tell the child you? 
<br><br>
I’d be like “Yeah. You’re alright. You’re going to be alright so just keep on going mate!” I don’t think I would change anything. 
<br><br>
>>>And your dreams or goals now?? 
<br><br>
Umm…(thinking)…do something that means something? I know that sounds really cheesy but I work in advertising, which means very little. And its loads of fun, and that’s really important - to have fun. I would love  to look back and say, “That meant something, that did something.
