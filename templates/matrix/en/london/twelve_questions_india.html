    <p><span class="name">India Bourne</span></p>
    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：29　Years in London: 6<br>
     <br>  
     India was introduced to me through Kelly, and meeting India was one of those funky cases (and incredibly lucky) where I was encountering a person I had known of previously. Back in Japan, I was asked to create a parody of an idol group’s pop song by one of my friends at NHK for a radio show. At that time, a different friend showed me a clip by Ben Howard doing a cover of “Call Me Maybe“ and I though it was one of the greatest things ever, eventually using it as inspiration for my own parody. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPU8V-nvUEk">Check out the clip</a>. Yes, India is the cellist for (and childhood friend of) Ben Howard. How freaking awesome. So when Kelly (who is friends with many a musician on both sides of the Atlantic) said she could introduce me to India, it was as if some Karma God magic was being performed right before my eyes. 
<br><br>
Anyway, so India was kind enough to take time out of her busy schedule before going on tour, and as I imagined, not only was she super nice (the day we met was bloody stormy), she gave some amazing answers. Actually, her goal (Q.12) might be the coolest answer yet! I also like her London aspects (Q.3), images (Q.5), and her moments (Q.11). So thanks again India, and I hope you guys will come to Japan to play one day!! (If not, I’ll just have to go to one of your shows elsewhere :) )  
    <br><br>
    India's own music is still in production and not out yet...so I guess you could listen to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.fr/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=ben%20howard">Ben Howard</a>? (Not that he really needs an introduction lol)

    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: So we’re on the South Bank. I thought this would be a good place for an interview because it’s right on the Thames and it’s where a lot of art and music and culture happens. It’s kind of a hub for a lot of London activity, and it’s a special place for me because of the proximity to the English National Opera where I used to work... I've always liked walking along the river and this is somewhere I used to stop and have a tea. So it’s a good spot in London.  </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/india/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   Oooooh…I…you know what, I think I’d go to India because I’ve only been there once. I went to Kerala to do yoga and a bit of surfing, but I didn’t really see a lot of India. I think I would go to a place called Rishikesh where I’ve heard of an amazing yoga centre. I'd go and just really absorb myself into yoga and the place and I'd probably travel around a little bit there. I’d love to spend a month there. That would be incredible! Yeah!
<br><br> 
>>>Did your name have anything to do with your fascination with India?  Because my name in Japanese is Leo, which is the same as Rio. So I’ve always wanted to Rio de Janeiro because of that. 
<br><br>
Ahhhh ! Yeah! India ! I think because a lot of people say to me, “Oh have you been? Were you born there? Were you conceived there?” (Leo laughs) I don't have a very interesting story about that. It's just because my parents loved the name India, and they are still yet to visit the country! So, yeah I guess I do have a fascination with India that is partially because of my name and also because I haven’t fully explored it yet. I guess I'm searching for my connection to it.
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  Hmmm….(Thinking)… such a good question. Closest to…? (Thinking)… I think… one place springs to mind. Before university I went to South America because it always had a real pull for me. I studied Spanish for A Level and we took a few courses on South America. So I was like, right,  I'm going to go there!
<br><br>
>>>Right ! 
<br><br>
During my trip I went to Buenos Aires and I stayed there for a few weeks. In my heart, I was like, I want to go back. I want to. When I left, I felt like I could live there… It’s an amazing part of the world, and I met so many cool people and had a wild time. I always wanted to go back. I felt somehow rested when I arrived there, even though I just got there, you know? 
<br><br>
Really? That’s pretty incredible! (Laugh) 
<br><br>
Yeah, it s kind of weird, isn’t it? I didn’t expect that. Because I went to quite a few places in South America, Buenos Aires was one that I just kind of stopped in for a bit. I felt “Yeah! This is cool. I'm happy”. You know? 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/india/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 Okay ! Ooh! It s a hard thing because not being from London. <br><br>
>>>That’s the point of the question ! (Laughs) 
<br><br>
Yeah, true, true, very true! So one thing and one place that represents…? Ah… (thinking) It’s got to be something to do with like the very centre of London for me. And also I'm biased because I’m a musician, it’s got to do with culture and arts and places where exciting arty things are happening. Ummm…oh! I m kind of torn, you know. I love the theatre district. But what, like, represents London?
<br><br> 
>>>Yes. 
<br><br>
Actually, you know what? I'm changing my mind. (Leo laughs) Where I live in Brixton, there’s a road called Atlantic Road. Atlantic Road sits underneath the railway so many of the archways have become shops. They sell everything from fruit and veg, retro fashion, to phones, bins and pots and pans. There are hairdressers, meat and fish stalls, cd shops blasting out reggae music really loud, fresh yellow mangoes from India, vegetables i've never seen before, carpets, fabrics, string vests... The list is endless. It’s a loud, fun, part of town to go to. You can get almost anything there! 
 So I guess the thing that represents London to me is that hustle-bustle of activity and being amongst loads of different cultures. I love it, it's something I didn't have growing up in the country in Devon.erse.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   Redesign the Union Jack…why not? I’d give it a crack!! The reason…Okay, so…Okay. I guess a couple of things come to mind when I think about Union Jack. What I like about is, it’s a combination of flags, right ? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. It’s very cool.  
<br><br>
It’s cool because it’s our United Kingdom, you know! I guess I quite like that. But if I was going to redesign it, what would properly… what would really represent  the United Kingdom? That's the hardest question of all really, because like I was saying, we have an amazing mixture of cultures that live here now. Over hundreds of years people have come and gone from all parts of the globe. So it’s a really difficult one. Ok, one thing I would inject in there if I was going to put in another colour is green. 
<br><br>
>>>Hmmm… interesting.
<br><br>  Because when I think of England, it rains a hell of a lot, (Laughs), right ? And so we’ve got a lot of green. I think that’s something I really celebrate about our country. <br>
It's nice because the Devon flag is a green flag with a white cross in it. And…I heard, actually, the Devon flag was only created not that long ago  when someone decided we needed a flag and launched a competition! But I like it because it’s got that green, and...and Devon is very green. It’s very luscious and green! Yeah, I m not a designer though, so I don’t know. 
<br><br>
>>>We’ll let the designers design it (haha) 


 </p>

<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/india/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean! It’s funny. The first thing that comes into my head is “the sea”, right? And I know that sounds ridiculous, but… but when I think of the ocean, we never call it “the ocean”.
<br><br> 
>>>Yeah I noticed that after I came here! Everybody says “the sea”.
<br><br> Yeah, it’s funny, right ?And I think that s something that’s kind of British, I guess. So nobody calls it the ocean where it’s an ocean. The Atlantic Ocean. So when you say ocean, I think sea.
<br><br> 
>>>Oh, that’s really cool. 
<br><br>
And I… I think of home. Again I think of green hills, cliffs and beaches. Devon's got some beautiful beaches.  We used to do a lot of walks, me and my family along the cliff edges of South Devon. It’s beautiful. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
The first thing I think of when I think of the sun… (Laughs) Well, I just watched this—this is weird, but this is the first thing I thought about, but there’s this amazing thing on youtube called The Known Universe, right? And it basically maps out everything that we know about our entire universe. It starts in the Himalayas and it zooms out and out and out and out and out and out and out so far, that like I mean, our sun is… TINY! It travels about 3 billion light years away, right? I probably got the numbers wrong. (Everyone laughs) But it zooms out so far, and it gets to the furthest point of anything we know about, everything that we’ve ever mapped. It just blows my mind! And then we zoom back in, and it goes just as fast back in, all the way in to earth again. I cannot fathom just how big the universe is! When I think about the earth let alone the sun, I think how big it is and when watching the clip, it made the sun look so miniscule. I was like…we must… (laughs) put things into perspective you know. I guess it’s powerful to feel my insignificance, mankind’s insignificance to some degree. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 Death. Ohhh, death…uh… (Thinking)… Light and shadow come into my mind. I dont know why it comes into mind. Actually purely from a conversation yesterday about… (Thinking)… light and dark in music, kind of, beginnings, ends, energy, stillness… I sound really like aerie-fairy, don’t I?  
<br><br>
>>>So light and shadow… does it mean light is on something that s creating a shadow, or is it just the concept of light and shadow ? 
<br><br>
It’s the concept of it. I guess it’s the concept of… it’s because we re talking about energy and death and transferring of energy, and then transferring of...I guess it was the contrast of light and shadow. I don’t think that really makes much sense. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) it’s okay.
<br><br> It makes me think of light and dark and that dark’s not necessarily… that death is not the end, if you know what I mean? We were talking about  how your energy, when you die, is transferred. So I guess it was that. It was like that darkness isn’t necessarily the end. It’s like a beginning. But I hope it doesn’t make me sound too pretentious? (Laughs) 

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Future ? (Thinking)… I’m very hopeful, I guess. You know, we’ve recently just had a new government. There is a lot of talking about that.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah election day was the second day I arrived! 
<br><br>
 Exactly. And that makes me think about the future because they’re talking about what’s going to happen here and there and everything…and whether or not you agree with said government, it’s about… it’s also about hope. I don’t know, when you think about “the flip side of despair is hope”. My Dad told me that, and I really like the image. It’s like whatever barriers you might put in your mind about how you can move forward as a person or how a group of people can move forward or communities move forward or when you think of problems ahead.I... I think as humankind we do think of problems and barriers. They kind of define a time in a way. So I like to also think of future in terms of the flip side of barriers and whether or not you agree with something or you don’t. With the election, as an example, it’s about hope and moving forward, I guess.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Thing for me ? (Thinking)… Loved ones! Family and my partner and my closest friends and loved ones. They are the most important thing.
</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  I look for… great question! I look for… becoming a team with someone and what qualities that brings. My partner and I, we are very much a team. And we’re different to each other, and that’s wonderful because we are always in conversation about things, and we’re always interested in what the other is in to. We can disagree about things and that’s kind of cool. I think we learn a lot in the process. 
What do I look for in a partner? I look to be challenged. I… I look for laughter and joy. Laughing is very important. I look for discussion and kind of looking really within yourselves and each other. 
<br><br>
>>>May I ask a question? When you say “team”, teams usually have a common goal. You do music, and I think sports and music, oh and business too, building the right team is the most crucial element. And in those cases there’s always something the team is striving for, a common goal. So when you say a relationship is “team”, do you have this kind of goal? 
<br><br>
I think it’s that you have a combination of skills and… (Thinking) …and outlooks… and goals that work together -- that may not be the same, that may be opposite in many ways, but that kind of… like you said. It’s like when you think of a partnership, you think of two people that can go forward together, that can change together, that support each other.  So, it’s like you re like working as a team towards something… like when I think about my grandparents. They were amazing. They were so much a team and they were quite different people. They gave each other space to be able to be who they were. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s very, very interesting! So you have an example!  
<br><br>
Yeah they worked really, really well together. Simple things. Granny would do the gardening, and Grandpa would do all the fixing up and stuff! And they loved that. They had their roles, and they worked together, and they were a team. So I guess it's working together. 
  </p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/india/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 >>> I checked out your… you have a pretty ring on your ring finger. 
<br><br>
I do. (Laughs)
<br><br> >>>So are you already married? Is that what it is? 
<br><br>
I’m engaged.
<br><br> 
>>>So you are going to get married! And do you want children?
<br><br>
I’d love to have children. 
<br><br>
>>>OK nice, so back to the original question! 
<br><br>
Hmmm… okay. Good question. I can’t wait to see who they re going to be. And I think by listening and watching and feeding in information, you can kind of, you…you find out who they are, you know? I read this great book about a community… it wasn’t directly about parenting. But it looked at nurturing the young people of their community. It focussed on giving them opportunities to see what their natural strengths were and where they liked to be--where their passions were.
<br><br>
 So in a similar way, what I’d like to do is give them loads of opportunities and expose them to lots of things, and listen to them. I think that's so important. They’ve got so much to say, and so much we can learn, you know? So…Yeah. I don t think I would push them— being a musician I wouldn’t push them into music. I think I’d just offer it.  You’ve got such a responsibility as parents. You can technically kind of… I don't know, you could not inspire them to be a musician even if they had those qualities. Because if you rammed it down their throat and said you have to play, they could be like “I don’t want to!” So for me, I think it's about giving them lots of options and listening to what they say. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Seeing my boyfriend sleeping. It makes me so…(Thinking)… calm. I like waking up before him. I like waking without an alarm and just seeing him very peaceful and sleeping. Yeah, makes me feel very calm. 
<br><br>
>>>And before you go to sleep? 
<br><br>
 (Thinking)…I’ve never thought about that…it’s such an interesting question! The ideal thing…? Again, my boyfriend, I think! That’s perfectly fine.
<br><br>  >>>I think your boyfriend will be happy to hear that! (India laughs)
 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/india/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Hmmm… (Thinking)… The happiest moment spring to mind… a lot of happy moments. (Thinking)… oh I almost can’t think of one! You know, actually, one of the happiest moments…was the first time that I got into a studio with other musicians to record my own music. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow!  
<br><br>
It felt incredible. These ideas that were previously flying around my head with no weight suddenly were being played and sung by others. I could stand back and appreciate it in a completely different way. “Woah! That came out. That worked!” And it’s not only with my stuff, but with other people’s stuff too, the fact that it comes out of the brain… it’s just mind-blowing. It was massively inspiring. I felt very humbled by it. I felt very thankful to these people for helping me with it. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s so cool. And the most terrifying moment?
<br><br> The most terrifying moment in my life. Hmmm… (Thinking)… (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>> (Laughs) You’re laughing! It’s the first time someone just becomes silent and starts laughing! Haha 
<br><br>
Haha yeah, it’s funny because the memory that came into my head was— the reason why I’m laughing, it seems a bit…well it’s being a kid lost in a supermarket. And it’s so funny because I hadn’t remembered that for ages! The most terrifying moment in my life. Because suddenly, you wander off, you’re looking at the crisps, and you wander off, go into another aisle, and you’re like three, and your mother is not there. And it feels like you can’t find her for about 3 days, and it’s really about 3 minutes. Not very deep, but it’s the first thing that came into my head. 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream…as I child  I was, and I still am, a big animal and nature lover. It plays a big role in my life, and is an inspiration. I wanted to care for things, and I guess I wanted to make things better, for animals so I wanted to be a vet. I grew up in the sticks, and I was in touch with all of that. The environment plays a big role in my life now, even though I am a musician and…the lifestyle is arguably not very environmentally friendly. We fly a lot, we travel a lot, and people travel a lot to get to our shows. Its almost like, the bigger you get as a musician, the farther people have to travel to get to our shows because you do all those shows. People come from further out.  In a way, your carbon footprint is not just yours.
<br><br>
>>>Wow I’ve never thought of that…. 
<br><br>
It does scare me. We've got a big summit coming up in Paris this year on climate change. We’ve got a lot of choices to make. We could become a 100% clean energy planet by 2050 I think it is… if we put that policy in place. We are on a knife-edge. We are arguably the generation that is responsible for making these big decisions that could affect the planet, forever.  So I guess…yeah, it worries me. I care about it a lot, even though my lifestyle is counter to that. It’s sort of a battle in my head actually. 
<br><br>
>>>So what would you tell your childhood you?? 
<br><br>
What would I tell her…? What would I tell my little self? I would say…this is going to sound very cheesy but its “You’re alright. You’re OK.” (Laughs) Because little kids have so much, well can have, a lot of angst. You’re growing up, you don’t really know what’s going on. I think I was a pretty carefree kid, but you worry a lot, especially a teenager. All the decisions you make for your school…So “Number one, you’re ok, you’re doing your best. That’s the best as anyone can do. If you’re doing your best in any situation, then great”. <br>
Another thing is… “trust your gut”. In the decisions you make in life…trust yourself, trust your gut. Follow your instincts. Because as we were talking before, what you choose to do in life is about passions and love for doing it. And I believe you’re going to be successful in what you are passionate about, because you’ve got that extra drive for it. So follow your gut, follow your instincts, follow your passions. And be true to yourself, because if you aren’t doing those things then…you have to make changes.  I really believe if you’re going for the stuff you really believe in, you’re going to be happy. <br>
I was in a cafe recently, a cafe in the states, Portland— 
<br><br>
>>>Portland?? Portland, Maine, or Portland, Oregon? 
<br><br>
Portland, Oregon! 
<br><br>
>>>That’s my hometown! Haha  (*They had played in Portland in mid-February 2015!)
<br><br>
No way ! So Well, I was in this really cool vegan café with Mickey, one of the band members and on the wall, it had written on this big plaque: “Work hard. Be nice.” I was struck by the simple truth of it. If everybody did that, and everybody did their best—yeah, people have a hard time but if people just did that, things would be much better. 
<br><br>
>>>Alright, finally, what’s your dream now? 
<br><br>
What’s my dream now? Aaaaah…not to go INSANE!!! (Everybody laughs) No, we’re all a little bit insane and I celebrate that, I celebrate that a lot. My dream now is to… (Thinking)… is to create more, actually. To give myself full permission to create, not be fearful, and give myself the freedom to do that. I guess that applies to a lot of things, not just me creating more music. I think my dream now is to not hold back! 
<br><br>
>>>Wow, what an incredible answer…“My dream now is not to hold back.” That should be written on a T-shirt somewhere. (India laughs)
