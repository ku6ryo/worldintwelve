    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in London: 2<br>
     <br>  
    James was introduced to me by Luis. First of all, click on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8BHZgCHQi8">this link</a>. It is the song James told me I should play for his introduction! Haha. Yeah, that was a first. Maybe you can tell from the song (and the pictures) but James is a music producer, and an amazingly talented one at that. For his shoot, he showed me around his studio and the complex which it’s in. The place was incredible, with a bunch of small office-like studios (rented out by a number of members in quite famous bands I won’t name here due to privacy) and a bigger recording studio. Basically a musician’s fantasy. James also had some of the coolest gear too which I could only dream of owning. OK, enough with the nerd talk. 
<br><br>
James was even nice enough to have me over for dinner that night, and I actually joined him and his girlfriend Laura (also an amazing person and fellow food lover) who hold regular brunch parties by renting out little shops throughout East London. Way too cool. For his answers, James went all out with each one. Every single one is detailed, filled with examples, and full of substance. If I were to choose, I’d say thing and place (Q.3), thing (Q.7), children (Q.9), and dreams (Q.12). So see you around James, I’m sure we’ll meet again! Come to Tokyo WITH Laura this time and we’ll have something good to eat!! 


</p>
       <br>
    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This is my studio in Homerton. Homerton is arguably, depending on who you are and what you do, the last affordable place in the borough of Hackney. Hackney was an
area which was previously regarded as a hot spot for crime. It wasn’t a place you
wanted to live in the year 2000. But the speed of gentrification, globally, not just
London, has made this really the only affordable place in London. Even then…this
room is small but you don’t even want to know how much money I spend every
month on it…too much. But I make it work.
<br><br>
>>>You’re close to the station!
<br><br>
Yeah, I’m close to the station (laughs). And this is a good place to do it [the interview]
because it’s quiet and not my flat. The best thing about this place is the fact that it’s
not my flat, because my flat is full of music shit that my girlfriend hated (both laugh).
<br><br>
>>>I hope she likes your music though!   </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/james/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   Well, it’s funny you say that because, I’ve just come back from holiday which
costs about that much and that was for two weeks (laughs). And the
holidays were in San Francisco, Austin, New Orleans, Houston, and back.
<br><br>
>>>Whoa that’s an awesome trip.
<br><br>
It was a good trip. Yeah, yeah. And in light of that, if I were given it now…
it would be one of two things. It would either be…I really want to go back
to the States. I want to do New York, Detroit, Chicago, music towns on
the opposite side. Or…to be honest, since I just came back from the
United States, I’d say Europe for longer. Did you say two weeks was the
limit?
<br><br>
>>>No no, one month!
<br><br>
One month!! Oh then Europe 100%. My money would go much further.
Go to New York? Fuck that! (Laughs) I wouldn’t last a week! (Laughs) I’d
want to go to Europe. Probably start off in…I’d like to go to the south of
France. Go to Bordeaux, make my way down to Spain. Barcelona, Madrid,
maybe Portugal. Then fly over to Italy. I’d go to the Amalfi Coast. I’ve
only just discovered it, and I’ve been obsessed….there’s this TV show
called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trip_(2010_TV_series)">“The Trip”</a> they’re doing here. It’s these two comedians playing
themselves, kind of this weird version of themselves, and they go on a
trip to Italy, and they go to the Amalfi Coast. I’ve been obsessed ever
since I’ve seen footage of it. 
<br><br>
>>>It looks absolutely beautiful.
<br><br>
Have you been?? No?? Yeah, it looks insane. And then…I’d probably go
back to Berlin, because I have loads of friends that live in Berlin. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Umm…it definitely would not be America. It’s weird, we speak the same
language, but we are SO FAR from each other. Umm…I guess Germany.
Honestly I think they…they’ve got the same list of problems that we have.
I think, in a way.
<br><br>
>>>Which would be…???
<br><br>
Umm…I think overall it’s just about…I feel that my country, despite what
happened in the past elections, in the overall grand scheme of things, it’s
a left leaning country. Like, I don’t…well it might just be me and my
friends and everything, but I don’t think it’s a right leaning country. Yeah,
it’s not a left, left, left “way out there” country--- I mean you’re about to
go to Stockholm.
<br><br>
[NOTE, from James: I did say this but don’t think it at all any more. The left lost pretty
badly at the election and I’ve realised all the hope and optimism on social
media was (sadly) just an echo chamber for my own views.]
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, which is way out there.
<br><br>
I don’t know…I just think Germany…people have a similar approach to
life. Living life there is just very similar to living life here, I think. I mean
when I compare London to Berlin, it’s notably cheaper to live in Berlin
compared to London. 
<br><br>
>>>And London is one of the most expensive places in the world.
<br><br>
Yeah, but even then, I feel it’s Germany, for me, there’s just something
similar. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/james/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
  It depends whether I’m in a good mood or a bad mood.
  <br><br>
>>>Can you give us one of each?
<br><br>
Yeah. The bad mood is Canary Wharf. Because Canary Wharf…well the
people that live in Canary Wharf, and work in Canary Warf, it seems are 
determined to turn London into Dubai but with shit weather. I feel…well
have you taken the DLR through Canary Wharf? No?? So the DLR is this
kind of monorail that has no driver, which is really weird, and you sort of
have this tour of capitalism. The monorail goes through the sky scrapers.
<br><br>
>>>Isn’t a lot of East London like that??
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah. It’s basically where all the banks are…well actually there is
one good thing in Canary Wharf, and its Billingsgate Market. If you can
muster yourself to get up early enough, I recommend you go there. It’s a
fish market, and you can get amazing fish there. But yeah, other than
that, Canary Wharf is a testament, sort of display of capitalism, I think.
That would be my bad mood.
<br><br>
In a good mood, I would say Peckham in South London. Peckham is still…I
think the vibe you feel in Peckham is still probably the vibe you felt in
Hackney 10 years ago. I’m going to a party in Peckham tonight at my
friend’s house. All my friends live in Peckham. If I moved down
here on my own volition and I was single, I would definitely choose to live
in Peckham. The rents are affordable…actually the rents aren’t that
different here, but you get more for your money, I guess. Say if you
were paying 600 quid [slang for pound] a month here, you would be
living in a small room. If you’re paying 600 quid a month in Peckham,
you’d have a large room with a garden.
<br><br>
>>>Wow.  <i>[NOTE from James: In even just the last half year, the rent in the same rooms in Peckham has risen to 700~800 pounds]</i>
<br><br>
And Rye Lane in Peckham is just buzzing. For example I’m going to get on
the train to go down there after this, and I know for a fact that it will be
buzzing. Friday night. I’ll be getting on from Dalston Junction to Peckham Rye, and it will just be
buzzing. Tonnes of young people. The streets
are alive.
<br><br>
The thing is, I moved here because of my girlfriend and work, and I have
to say I love Hackney. It’s…if you like the things she likes, like going out
to have good food, good bars and everything, it’s really really great.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, the Hackney, Shoreditch area has been incredible!
<br><br>
Yeah it’s great. But if you were young, an artist, and wanted something
with a little more edge―Peckham. And Peckham, you know, gives me a
little bit of hope. I see the parties held down there, the people down
there―it’s got the most animated people. It’s really got its own thing
going on. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   (Thinking)…ummm…I don’t know. The Union Jack…it’s…it’s almost like
when two artists collaborate…and take the easy way out… Like, my name
is James, and your name is Leo, so we decide to call ourselves J-Leo…
that’s basically what the Union Jack is. (Leo laughs) It’s really an
unimaginative idea―let’s just put three flags on top of each other. But
from a design perspective, it kind of works. The cross, the lines, yeah, it
works.
<br><br>
I don’t know. Probably not. But the one thing I would say is, I don’t know
if you’re familiar with the referendum in Scotland, and how the Scottish
voted last year.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah they just barely are a part of the UK still.
<br><br>
Yeah, they’ve just become uninterested in us. They’ve totally lost it. And I
totally get their vibe. So if I were to redesign it, I guess I’d just say, that
in the next 10 years it will most likely look different. It won’t have the
Scottish flag in it anymore. That’s what I think. It’s my prediction. I won’t
redesign it, but it will be redesigned.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/james/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Space.
<br><br>
>>>Space?
<br><br>
The idea of the ocean is one of those things like…living in London, I suppose, you
become very, very aware of space. And I think the the big thing about staring out into
the ocean is that concept of “nothing”…like the fact that there is nothing.
Also the image of the ocean is just terrifying, like all those open water stories. Where
people are just stuck in open water…Fuck! What a horrible way to go. You know,
those people who go diving and their boat is going. “FUCK!!” (laughs) “I’m in the
middle of nowhere and this is it!!” Yeah…so space.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Heat…I don’t know. Holidays. Although it’s not really sunny here.
<br><br>
>>>I’ve been pretty lucky.
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah. The weather… honestly, I think London is sort of in a micro-climate. I
lived in Northern England for most of my life, and when I hear the people in London
complain about the weather I’m just like… ”Fuck, you try living up north!” (Leo
laughs). It just rains a lot up north. It rains all year. There’s never ever any guarantee 
it’s not going to rain. And here, there’s sort of a guarantee of that. Here when it rains,
it’s like “a shower here“; it’s never like “AAAAGGHH RRAAIINNNN” (Leo laughs). It’s
always just raining in Manchester, so yeah, holidays.
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Umm…what do I think of…I feel like it’s really really…I feel I’m underprepared to
answer you that question. I could only name a few people that are even a little close
to me that have died.
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
It’s interesting because…well there’s this really really good interview that I was
reading the other day, and it was about this artist who actually summed up the
answer to that question really well. His name is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Herbert">Matthew Herbert</a>. Absolutely
amazing producer, one of my favorites, a classical house producer. He’s worked with
big bands, all kinds of music.
<br><br>
>>>Could you give us an example?
<br><br>
Well…he does a lot of his own stuff. He hasn’t really produced other bands. He
made an incredible concept album revolving around the life and death of a pig. Like
all the stuff I showed you with samplers, he’s the Don of all that. And going back to
the interview, in it he talks about his latest album, in which he’s dealing with the
concept of his own personal future, which he’s so positive about. He’s got a young
kid, a stable career, everything that he really wants. But he’s also aware that his
happy existence is on top of a system that is so grossly unfair. And he’s made a
concept album about that.
<br><br>
>>>Wow…very interesting.
<br><br>
Yeah, really interesting. I haven’t heard anything of it yet, but if you just search
<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.liveschool.net/qa-matthew-herbert-interview-uk-studio-k7-accidental/">“Matthew Herbert live school interview”</a> you’ll find it. Posted last week [as of May,
2015].
<br><br>
And so regarding this, my thoughts…honestly, I think my life is going well. I live in a
nice flat with my girlfriend,  And I love her, and we are having an amazing time living together, so that’s going well. And I have this studio, this room, and yeah, sometimes I may have to mix a track that I don’t really like, but
in the grand scheme of things, it’s a great existence. Honestly, I spend everyday 
here, in this room, and after I finish teaching, I work on a personal project. And I’m
hoping, optimistically in the future, that it will pull through. So everything is good.
<br><br>
But in the general scheme of the world, I feel terrible. Yeah, I just…it’s just…going to
America was an eye opener. Particularly…just…I think so many people have got it
wrong over there. That thing that’s going on in Baltimore is just fascinating [referring
to the riots going on at the time]. Have you seen “The Wire”? Yeah? Have you read
the article on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/08/david-simon-capitalism-marx-two-americas-wire">“The Two Americas”? By David Simon</a>?? It’s the best thing of writing
that you’ll read. It was in <i>The Guardian</i>, and it was taken from a speech he
gave in Australia. “The Wire” is all about “The Two Americas”; one, the one you were
probably brought up in, where you go to a decent school and go to college and all
that, and the other, where America is in the habit of dismissing people. The idea of
“The Loser.” I think it’s just an infectious and obnoxious thing.
<br><br>
And it’s not just America. It’s the world. We’ll just discard people, like that. I don’t
know. I feel like things are getting worse in a lot of places, and the the human race is
regressing, which I feel is a scary thing. And we’re living on the tip of it.
<br><br>
At the same time, I’m benefitting from the system, and living quite well. I struggle to
articulate it…I’m sure Matthew Herbert’s album will be better than what I just said.
Listen to his record (laughs).

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/james/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Um…(Thinking)…stability.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Interesting…
<br><br>
Yeah honestly, I think I’m pretty boring. And it’s a boring answer but I think it’s the
truth.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah not many people answer that.
<br><br>
Yeah I think even people who…like, all the people I know that like to take risks and
do all these crazy things need to have this…well the reason you can even take these
risks is because you have a certain level of stability. And I think I’ve always been
quite good with money, which is a boring thing to say as well, but I save, if I can’t
afford to go out, I won’t go out, etc. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah I know…but yeah because I saved up I can do this. This studio cost me a
fortune. To get everything set up…I ran this operation through my dining room table
for years. And convinced people to come and take Ableton lessons at my dining
room table. Rubbish. I put away half of the stuff I own. I put myself through school of
audio engineering by saving up. I needed seven grand for that so I moved back in
with my parents, which was really crap. When you’re 20 years old, you don’t want to
move back in with your parents, that REALLY sucks. But it was a means to ends. So,
yeah, stability. I think I encourage myself to take more risks. It’s like my new years
resolution every year (both laugh). 
</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Ah, stability! (Both laugh) Well…you know I think I’ve kind of found it now. What do I
look for…(thinking)…a strong moral compass. And someone that you can…I don’t
know. I really struggle to answer that question.
<br><br>
>>>No answer is always a good answer too.
<br><br>
It’s almost like that question “what type are you?” I think people are too complicated
to sum up with that kind of thing. I mean, I can describe Laura, but that’s just what it
is. She’s…just a sensible person that still likes to have fun. But yeah, I have no idea
how to answer that question. Sorry. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/james/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yeah.<br>
Children: Yeah.
<br><br>
Listening to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin">Aphex Twin</a>. (Leo laughs) Being like a…oh you know, I got this at a
record shop in America [takes out a record].
<br><br>
>>>You know I’m good at doing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=aphex+twin+face&biw=1424&bih=734&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7hrif0KbJAhWlUqYKHTCMBqIQ_AUIBigB">Aphex Twin face</a>?? [Does face]
<br><br>
Oh!! That’s amazing!! That’s pretty good, that’s a party skill! (Leo laughs). So I got
this, I found this in a record shop in America, and I’m going to use it to make a track
one day. So the theory behind this record right…what year is this from? 1974?
<br><br>
>>>Wow.
<br><br>
[Starts reading writing from record]…So as <i>Newsweek</i> recently reported,
when a newly born baby returns home for the first time from the hospital, the parents
quickly discover that the howling does not always come from hunger, fatigue, or a
wet diaper. Now it’s been suggested that crying babies may be just homesick for the
familiar environment of their mother’s womb. This is a recording of a mother’s womb.
Track 1: Under the main artery of the mother. Track 2: Sounds of the artery and
veins of the mother.
<br><br>
>>>So the idea is you play this to your newborn infant after it comes home from the
hospital.
<br><br>
Exactly. “Lullaby From the Womb”. So good. So what do I want to do?? I want to be
a parent that plays them this! I want to see if it really works. Like that could be cool. I
don’t know. Maybe having kids in this world is a little bit selfish. Sometimes I think of
that. But at the same time, I think it would be great. We live in an era now where
childhood is prolonged for longer and longer and longer.
<br><br>
Have you ever seen the TV show <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced">“Spaced”</a>? No?? It’s the most amazing thing ever.
Have you ever heard of Simon Peg? He was in Star Trek as Scotty, in the most
recent JJ Abrams thing. So he’s this big comedian and he’s in this British TV show
called “Space,” which I highly recommend. It’s loosely based around the idea that
you can be an adolescent forever. It’s really funny. And people are having kids so 
much later now, people are being more selfish, and not necessarily in a bad way. It’s
just now…you can prolong the time where it’s just about “you”. Maybe it’s a byproduct
of capitalism. I mean…look at my parents…my parents were, well my
mother was 24 when she had me. Holy hell. You think about people having kids at
24, that’s really young. And that’s it. That’s the first thing that pops into my head. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
You know what, the ideal thing would be, if we’re talking senses, would be silence. I
have tinnitus [link], and I haven’t experienced silence for a year. Because right when
you fall asleep, that’s when tinnitus bothers me the most. I mean it doesn’t affect me
at all right now with all this background noise. It’s one of those things…I can get over
this but yeah, I have tinnitus because I’ve been a fucking idiot and turning up the
volume too loud. All this deejaying.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, deejaying…
<br><br>
Yep, deejaying with really loud monitors for long amount of times. Yeah, all these
fucking stupid decisions. It’s just regret really, every time you hear that ringing noise.
It’s a broadband now too, not just high frequencies. I’m a sound sleeper, but if one
day, I woke up and my tinnitus was gone—which has happened to some people so
I’m praying—that would be ideal.
<br><br>
When I go to bed…yeah the really sappy answer. My girlfriend. I really like falling
asleep next to her. 

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/james/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Um…(Thinking)…I mean, I just think back to holidays and things, when I think about
being really happy and content. There were some moments while in San Francisco
that…I’m trying to think of examples…you know what? Happiest moment of recent
memory would be when we were in San Francisco. And we were there for that really
cheesy weed festival…4/20?
<br><br>
>>>Oh you were in San Francisco on 4/20?? [Referring to April 20th] The day of??
<br><br>
Yeah yeah, we were in Golden Gate Park.
<br><br>
>>>What, you weren’t in Dolores Park??
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah we were staying near Dolores Park so we went there many times
before, and we wanted to try the other one. So we went to Golden Gate Park and we
bought a joint for a dollar. We smoked some weed, and we got absolutely zonked
with that joint (laughs). Because here, you mix it with tobacco.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, so I hear.
<br><br>
And I hadn’t been smoking too much weed recently. I smoked a lot when I was in
Liverpool, but here, I’ve got stuff on (laughs). Too much stuff on, I don’t really have 
the time. And you only really smoke weed when you’ve got nothing on (laughs). And
then we stumbled into a bar, in Height Ashbury…
<br><br>
>>>It’s one of the weed capitals of San Francisco.
<br><br>
Yeah, and it’s also totally cheesy and crappy (laughs). It’s like Camden.
People go there with like a guitar over there shoulder and it’s like, “Dude, you got the
memo 50 years too late. I’m sure this was sick in the 1960s” (both laugh). It’s pretty
much just a giant bong shop now (both laugh again). Anyway, there’s this one bar
there that is absolutely amazing. It’s called “Alembic” It had the best bar
snacks menu I’ve ever seen. You’re a food guy right…[starts searching on phone]…
oh I’ve been telling this to everyone…here it is. “Jerk spiced duck hearts, with pickled
pineapple and thyme salt” - the best thing I’ve eaten.
<br><br>
>>>You’re making me hungry.
<br><br>
Yeah it was on a little kebab skewer, and it was amazing. But the best time was right
after that when we had pizza by Dolores Park. It was the best pizza I’ve ever had.
Just cloud 9. I’m stoned, it’s a warm evening, I’m with Laura, I’m eating this amazing
pizza, and I had a great day. And it was supposed to be the crap day too, we had
nothing planned. But it turned out to be the best day of our holiday.
<br><br>
>>>That’s great! 4/20 experience as the happiest moment (laughs).
<br><br>
I know I know (laughs). I’m not a subscriber. I fully expected that when I got there it
would be 100 dudes with bongos on a hill or something, but it was more like 4000. It
was insane.
<br><br>
>>>Terrifying moment?
<br><br>
(Thinks)…I don’t know. It wouldn’t be anything recent.
<br><br>
>>>I’ve been talking with you so I’ve heard a few stories of you deejaying.
<br><br>
Yeah, but those are really just nerves…not really terrifying. Terrifying is when you
have a threat or danger to yourself or loved ones…so ok. We go back a few years.
Back when I was in Liverpool and I came home to my flat to discover that it had been
burgled. It was a slow realisation. I was on the phone with my girlfriend of the time,
and realised that she was the last one to leave the flat. And these dudes turned up…
we had been targeted. It was five dudes. Kicked the door
open. No one was in, but if they had turned in 30 minutes earlier, my girlfriend would
have been there. That shit me up so much, because it would have become from
something where I got my computer stolen and stuff, to something that would have
been in the fucking news. Like, really gruesome thing. So yeah, that’s probably the
most terrified. Other than being a kid and being terrified of all kinds of shit (laughs). 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Funny enough, childhood dreams is like when you want to be the coolest guy in the neighborhood or something? 
<br><br>
>>>That works! 
<br><br>
Ok…childhood dream was probably to be…in a band. Probably. Actually it depends
on which part of childhood. When I was really younger I wanted to be an artist. I was
really into drawing. When I got older, I wanted to be an actor for a bit, because I was
into drama. And then it was music. It was music from 12 onwards. That’s what I
wanted to do…anything that I was asked to do was twisted into music. That was like
a dream.
<br><br>
What would I say to my childhood me? “The people you admire are not gods. They
just got their shit together. And you can too.“ The biggest problem about being
brought up in Liverpool, in my opinion, if you are into artistic pursuits, is you’ve never
met anyone who has succeeded in it. So it just feels so unattainable. All my favourite
bands were London bands. I was just hooked on them…my favorite band was <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Party">Bloc
Party</a>. I was obsessed with them. And actually I now know Gordon Moakes [former bassist and founding member of Bloc Party] quite well.
<br><br>
>>>That’s awesome!! I loved “Silent Alarm”.
<br><br>
Yeah, Paul Epworth, the producer, huge, you know for Adele and Florence and the
Machines, did three records that year. He did “Silent Alarm” for Bloc Party, he did
“Capture/Release” for The Rakes, and he did The Futureheads debut album, which I
can’t remember the name of. Yeah, that just turned me on. That was the most
exciting shit in the world for me, at the time. And the other band that shaped me
massively was Radiohead, and they probably got me into electronic music. I still
listen to their records in awe. How fucking good they sound. So yeah, I would say
“Don’t put all those people you admire on a massive pedestal. They just got their shit
together.”
<br><br>
And the more I get into music, making records, and the more I get into the
mechanics of it, I’m just like…it doesn’t make me…I still appreciate those records.
But, once you understand the mechanics, it becomes, “Yeah it’s really good, but I
know how you did it.”
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, that I think is everybody’s first step in music production.
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah, exactly. It’s like…it’s not a dark art. It’s difficult to do well, to be really
good is difficult, but…yeah, still in some instances I’m like “Wow. I really don’t know
how you did that.” I listen to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burial_(musician)">Burial</a>, I listen to Aphex Twin, I’m like “Fuck me. I do not
know what you did there”. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AWIqXzvX-U">“Rhubarb”</a> by Aphex Twin. “I don’t know how you did
that…” It’s synths, but how did you make the sound like that, you…you clever guy.
<br><br>
And my dreams now. I’ve got…I want to…in my life, I want kids. I want to live happily
ever after. I want to stay living in London for a bit…and maybe move on to
somewhere else. Before it becomes too much like Dubai (laughs). And music wise, I
want to release techno records. And I want to produce artists. Sit at the mixing desk,
and make people sound amazing. That’s the general theme for me.
