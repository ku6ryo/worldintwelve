    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: We are right here in the park next to Hackney Central. And I really like this park because there are tons of different green stuff.  Trees, flowers, and tombstones and it’s pretty calm. And it’s huge. And that’s it.
 </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  Free? Free like, like what?
<br><br>
>>>Like free as in whatever you like. 
<br><br>
(Laughs) Okay…(thinking)…well, actually, I was dreaming about the sea today. So I would like, as usual, to go to the ocean or to the sea. And I think I would choose an island in Thailand since I have never been there. I have been to Bali. Well, only once. And then… I will rent a house and paint. And rest. Yeah, for a month.
<br><br>
>>>Very good.
<br><br>
I would like to sell those paintings as well. (laughs) Afterwards because I have to earn 14,000 pounds for my future stay in London, here. Otherwise, I won’t be able to stay here. So I will eat fruit, swim in the ocean, paint, and get some sun. 


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 I can’t say both? [Referring to Russia and England]
<br><br>
>>>You can’t say either.
<br><br>
What should I say?
<br><br>
>>>What country do you feel closest to other than those two? 
<br><br>
Closest… (thinking)…(laughs)
<br><br>
>>>If you don’t have an answer, you can say I don’t have one.
<br><br>
Well, Berlin? Not all of Germany but just Berlin.
<br><br>
>>>That works.
<br><br>
Yeah, I feel very welcome there.
<br><br>
>>>Hmm. Why is that?
<br><br>
I don’t know. I just...not only because there’s a really good vibe there and there are lots of young artists and people doing stuff and it’s very active and fun, but also because I believe that since the last century, there were huge, terrible things going on between Russia and Germany. And I would have been kicked out, or killed, or raped, in Germany 60 years ago. And now, in Berlin, I feel like just in the air, I feel like I’m welcome there and everything’s friendly. And it’s really weird. It’s just, it’s not visible. It’s just a sense. Yeah.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Well, for me, the best thing about London is that it’s so green. And my college, Central Saint-Martin is situated by the canal. And I used to live in a  place where I had to take a ride by bike through the canal. And it’s really green and nice. And there are some boats and there is this one red boat. So I think this red boat [represents] London because London has a lot of red things. You know which ones, and so when I see this red boat and the canal and all these trees around - this is what represents London for me. 
<br><br>
>>>All right.
<br><br>
Although it’s similar to Amsterdam. (Both laugh) But that’s what I like about that.

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
[Karina chose the Russian flag over the Union Jack]
<br><br>
Well I think it would be a nice idea if all countries would choose an image that represents their country and put it on the flag. Then I would choose like a Jackson Pollock painting because - 
<br><br>
>>>Wait, for your Russian flag?
<br><br>
Yeah. Because (laughs) it’s so chaotic and messy. And yeah. (laughs) I think it’s the very opposite to all flags because they all have these shapes that are strict.
<br><br>
>>>The whole point of Jackson Pollock is that there’s no meaning. So…that’s a pretty cool answer. And then…wow. It’s interesting because he’s my favorite artist, by the way.
<br><br>
Really?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah.
<br><br>
Yeah, then I think maybe you should go to Russia. (Leo laughs)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/karina/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Pssh! Pssh! Pssh! [Makes loud sounds with her mouth] (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Is this the image?
<br><br>
(Laughs) I thought I could make some sounds, no? 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
(Thinking)…“Following the Sun.” There is a song. (laughs) But I don’t remember. (Both laugh) Yeah, I’m trying to remember this song but I don’t know. “Following the Sun”? No? 
<br><br>
>>> I could put a link on it when we post this. (laughs)
<br><br>
I think it’s the Beatles, right?
<br><br>
>>>Uh huh. It fits because it’s London too so. I mean it’s England.
<br><br>
Yeah, I just went to Paul McCartney’s concert.
<br><br>

—Death<br>
(Thinking)…Death. Well. Hmm…(thinking)…(laughs)  This is the end! [In a deep voice] (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Who sang that?
<br><br>
The Doors!
<br><br>
>>>The Doors, like the band, The Doors? 
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, okay. Wow.  One was a sound of the ocean and two were songs. Wow!

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Well, I would like to live somewhere by the sea. So I would like to imagine myself being on a boat. My own boat. And also I would like to have a garden. Yeah. And…(thinking)… have a family living in a very nice place but not far from the city. And work hard, (laughs) play hard.
<br><br>
>>>Do you have an image for mankind? All of mankind has an image?
<br><br>
Well, I think that they think that they rule (laughs). But if you look as an alien from outside of our planet, then you will see that mostly this planet… is filled by creatures from the water, because it’s like 70 percent water. There are so many other animals so if you would be an alien, and you wouldn’t divide a creature by its intelligence level, then you would see that there are so many other creatures. Like they dominate over  human beings. So it’s not “our planet” really, in which we’re used to feeling like we are kings here. We can die but they will stay.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Health and love.
<br><br>
>>>You chose two, which is okay. (laughs)

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Talent and kindness. 
<br><br>
>>>Talent. How would you define talent?
<br><br>
 (Thinking)…The desire to make something extraordinary and beautiful. I don’t know. Like to create, to share your thoughts, your reality through the medium. And to be able to do it well. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>And to be able to do it well. I see. So that’s where the talent comes in…(Karina laughs) Because a lot of people can try but whether they have talent or not…that’s what I was wondering when you said talent. 
<br><br>
Well the ability to believe in what you are creating.
<br><br>
>>>Ah, okay. Nice. 
<br><br>
And then…(thinking)…the rest comes. But kindness is also very important. (laughs)

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/karina/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Well, I “improvised” marriage ten years ago. And since I’m with the same partner now, we didn’t even think about making a real marriage.
<br><br>
>>>I see. 
<br><br>
That one was pretty good, like, ten years ago. I dressed myself in the wedding dress.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, wow.
<br><br>
I bought it with my own money. I collected money and went to a wedding salon and pretended I was already 18 and that I was going to be married.
<br><br>
>>>Wow!
<br><br>
And it was like a classical white dress. And I had white gloves and earrings and everything. And then of course I had Converses.  (Leo laughs)  No heels, as I told you. I was not a very normal bride. And then I ran to my boyfriend and he didn’t expect anything. And I also had ten white balloons and I ran through the whole city, I just felt like running.
<br><br>
>>>Age 16. St. Petersburg…the entire city? That’s not a small city.
<br><br>
Well, it’s not that I lived really far from the place. From Nevsky Prospect, the main street and then there is the main bridge, the most famous bridge, Aniskov Bridge and we met there. And he was really surprised and happy and then we were walking around the city and met almost all of our close friends. All my close girlfriends just by accident. We didn’t call anybody. We didn’t want to call anybody but we just met them. There’s 6 million people in the city! But after that, we thought [about marriage], “what do we need it for?” And it’s too much hassle and you have to really care about it and it’s expensive. And what does it change? And so on. But now since I’m applying on different visas...
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, there’s legal matters.
<br><br>
Yeah, we started to think that we should make it official because I could be rejected since I’m not married. And can easily meet somebody and marry here and stay.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. Do you want children, though?
<br><br>
Yeah. I want children. My partner doesn’t want children.
<br><br>
>>>Oh.
<br><br>
Not now.
<br><br>
>>>Not now, okay. Yeah, but in the future?
<br><br>
Well every five years, he says “five years later.” (Leo laughs) And then I see that he’s not ready at all. He’s almost 30. He’s gonna be 29 this year.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, so he’s older than you? 
<br><br>
Well no it’s one and a half year’s difference. I’m going to be 27. He’s going to be 29. It’s all… well when you get old.
<br><br>
>>>When you get old! (Both laugh) Ok now to the second part. 
<br><br>
Well I would like them to be very conscious about how they treat their bodies and I would like…(thinking) them or myself to participate in the new education program. So instead of always studying stuff we learn at school and never, never, never ever use. We finished this shitty school that caused a lot of stress and it was just a horrible experience, my 11 years of school. And instead of just algebra, chemistry, boring history and so on, I would teach people how to breathe, how to eat, how to sleep, how to walk. How to sit. We don’t know anything about our bodies and we don’t care until we get a disease and even then, we just trust doctors. But instead of all this bullshit we studied in school, we could have studied real things about ourselves. About our bodies and minds. And it would be amazing. We would be completely different and we wouldn’t trust the companies that sell us such horrible things. And they don’t even care because they care only about their own families. They don’t care about these cookies, that if you eat them for 20 years, you will definitely will get something. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Well… I worked in Australia once and I lived by the ocean and I was hearing the waves all the time. It was nice. So I imagine myself just waking up and seeing the freshness of the ocean because it’s like a mental shower. You really feel refreshed after you just stay next to it. And I think it’s a very good way to start the day. And what I would like to see when I fall asleep? Of course I would like to see enormous number of stars. And I saw on this beach in Sydney when I was lying on the sand. Yeah, it was really beautiful. So just a huge amount of stars, universe, space.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
(Thinking)…Well, I think the most wonderful moment in my life was somehow connected to my relationship. And in the beginning, we were really happy being together and maybe…yeah, I don’t know. It’s hard to choose one. But this moment when we had the wedding, it was really, really beautiful. And then afterwards, I fall asleep. And he wrote me a letter that it was the best day in his life. 
<br><br>
>>> Nice! What about…it’s sad to talk about terrifying things after that but…(laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. Well…(thinking)…(laughs) I just don’t know.
<br><br>
>>>If you don’t have one, you can say you don’t have one.
<br><br>
I don’t have one. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>You’ve never been terrified in your life. That’s good. 
<br><br>
Well, in Russia, you are terrified constantly. (Leo laughs) It’s like a total shock. Always. It’s like you can really see very miserable things.
<br><br>
>>>I see. You don’t wanna explain that?
<br><br>
 Yeah. Just. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>We’ll just leave it at that. 
<br><br>
Well I can say that my mother is drinking, as lots of Russian people do, and it’s pretty awful when you see horrible things in your family. And…yeah. It’s kind of hard because you really… cannot really help. 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My dream now is to be active and healthy. To be healthy is the most important thing in my life. And the childhood dream was to be an artist and to marry a French man.
<br><br>
>>> (Laughs) Well, you sort of got half of it! He’s not French, is he?
<br><br>
No.
<br><br>
>>>That’s what I thought! (laughs) So what would you tell your childhood you now?
<br><br>
That I love Russians the most. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>You love one Russian person the most, or…?
<br><br>
 No…(laughs). Yes, exactly, but I cannot compare my Russian friends to…OK, I don’t know a lot of French people but every time I meet a non-Russian person it’s so different from meeting a Russian person.
<br><br>
>>>That’s just boys, girls, doesn’t matter?
<br><br>
Doesn’t matter. It’s much easier for me to get really close with Russian people. Yeah. And I see the difference. So I even say to people that if they don’t have a couple, they have to go to Russia. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>They don’t have a what?
<br><br>
A couple. Like a partner.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, you do always say that! You even said it to me! (Laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. And I said it to one Portuguese guy.
<br><br>
>>>You said it to one Portuguese guy.
<br><br>
Yeah, the moment we were together. Yeah. I love Russian people. Despite the part of the toughness in all of them. Because they can be really tough. And every time when I meet some random Russian, I just try to avoid them. I mean those tough, very conservative Russians. I mean the young Russian generation which was raised when I was born, when the Soviet Union fell down and there was no system - we were raised when there was nothing.
<br><br>
It was so wild. It was really, really dangerous and fun. (laughs) In the 90’s. I was very young in 90’s so it was the beginning of 2000 but it was still very, very wild.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. I can’t even imagine.
<br><br>
No, I see how people grew up here. And they’re like, “wow!” [When they hear about Karina’s childhood] (Leo laughs) It’s a completely different thing. (Both laugh)
