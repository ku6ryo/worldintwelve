    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：23　Years in London: 3 Months<br>
     <br>  
    Michael was one of my roommates in London. We lived in one of those multiple room flats catered to Airbnb in this day and age, where people are coming and leaving all the time. Michael, Willem (who’ll come in a special Brussels version), and I were the few long-term stays. Michael also was the only one  there who actively engaged in some sort of social conversation lol. So the socialising went on, mostly between Michael, me, and one of Michael’s girl-friends who ran away from her home in Copenhagen and joined the flat midway through my stay. The two of them created a pretty interesting perception of Danish people for me—especially after one night when I was invited to a pub nearby. I arrived late, around 11pm and the two of them were playing a drinking game (normal), where the loser had to answer a question given by the winner, on lighthearted topics such as “Is religion more beneficial or harmful to society” (Yeah, not so normal). I also wandered upon them in the kitchen one morning reading and discussing Oscar Wilde. Yeah, so as you probably would assume, Michael’s answers are interesting. I’d recommend the place and thing (Q.3), the flag (Q.4), the future (Q.6), and his moments (Q.11). So Michael, see you around, and we can have more fun conversations in Tokyo next time!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  It seems like a natural place to meet up because this place… well, this place is the reason why I chose to move to London. Because I got an internship here. 
<br><br>
>>>Basically, it's the V&A! 
<br><br>
It's the V&A, yeah! 
 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/michael/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   I think I would like to travel to a quiet and isolated place. Maybe, one of the small, not too touristy Greek islands. Just a place that offered space for reflection and relaxation. That'd be good!
<br><br>
>>>Get out of the hectic, modern lifestyle.
<br><br>
Exactly! I think it's pretty natural to long for these places when you're used to living in the city. So, yeah.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Okay. I think I'll go… I'll go with Holland. To be more specific, Amsterdam.
<br><br>
>>>Why?
<br><br>
 Well, because It feels like my second home. And I don't have to do anything particular. Just sitting next to the canals outside a cafe while I’m soaking up some sunshine makes me feel relaxed. I think it's the atmosphere and the attitude of the people… and yeah. It seems like a good place for me. I would like to eventually move there, at some point.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/michael/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Can the thing and the place be the same?
<br><br>
>>>Yes, they can be the same.
<br><br>
I would say the Millennium Bridge. Because, in a way, it connects the past with the present. The past being St. Paul's Cathedral, on the north bank. The present cathedral was built between 1675 and 1710. That place seems to…(thinking)… it has held many important services, like the funerals of Lord Nelson and Sir Winston Churchill and the jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria. I think it is a very important place in terms of the country’s national identity. St Paul’s is the symbol of the past. 
<br><br>
The present is symbolized by Tate Modern, which is located on the south bank of the River Thames, on the other side of bridge. It holds this amazing collection of contemporary art from the 1900s up to the present day. And it seems to be one of the city’s main cultural centers where people of all ages and from all cultural backgrounds gather to look at great works of art. I think I’m a bit biased by choosing this museum as a place.
speaker 2: We are all biased in our own ways and that’s what makes us interesting.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
 It could be interesting to paint it all gray. I recently read a quote from the German artist, Gerhard Richter, saying that “gray is the epitome of non-statement”, since it does not trigger off feelings or associations, I don’t know if I completely agree with that, but it is an interesting thought nevertheless.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. I don’t know if this is going to go on the site, but what would you do for Denmark? Would you make it all grey too? 
<br><br>
If I had to redesign the Danish flag?
<br><br>
>>> You don’t have to (laughs)
<br><br>
Well, if it had to symbolize the youth of Denmark, I would paint it all black. I would maybe put some white sneakers in the middle of the flag. (Leo laughs) Because everyone seems to wear long coats including myself and sneakers. Well, I don’t wear sneakers yet, but yeah.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean. Ever changing waves. …Is that a boring answer? (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>No… ever changing. Why ever changing?
<br><br>
 I like to just watch the ocean. It can be calm and still, yet ever-changing. That’s pretty interesting.
<br><br>
>>>True, each wave is different from the last. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Source of life. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Very, that one’s very easy to understand.
<br><br>
Well, the ocean is a source of life too.
<br><br>

—Death <br>
I think of this medieval allegory, ”Danse Macabre”, which features death personified as a dancing skeleton leading people of all stance into the grave while they’re dancing. And the phrase goes like, “the dance of death unites us all”. I kind of like that phrase… It’s a necessary evil for life to have a purpose I suppose: Death. 


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Okay. (Thinking)… Everything seems to be going very fast these days in terms of technological innovation. And I am not sure if it is all for the better. In terms of social media technologies which were supposed to bring us closer to each other, it seems to have had quite the opposite effect, everyone seems be…hmm, in the hunt for more recognition and acknowledgement. And I definitely think that this focus on the ’self’ rather than the Other has some negative consequences. Well, for example, the feeling of loneliness is a topic I have discussed with many of my friends. It is definitely a symptom of this age. People are not getting more connected with each other in real life. But I definitely think there will be a reaction against the so-called social medias at some point, hopefully. But yeah. Future’s uncertain.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
I guess… I guess it’s being happy and having the feeling that what I do serves a bigger purpose. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. How do you apply that to what you’re doing right now?
<br><br>
Well… by offering the public insight into the history of different objects. An understanding of history is important. You have to learn from the past to understand the present and be better prepared for the future. But my job is also to give people experiences, it’s something I really love doing. My aim is definitely to give people experiences that are interesting and engaging and beneficial in the end. 

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
In a partner? Loyalty, honesty, and a sense of humor. …It’s as simple as that…or it’s supposed to be (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. I don’t think you need to elaborate on that. It’s pretty simple. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/michael/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: I’m not scared of the idea of getting married, but I guess that’s something I’ve yet to decide. Yeah. I haven’t thought about that yet. (Laughs)<br>
Children: I think that would be the same answer. (Laughs) Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Are you leaning towards more yes or no?
<br><br>
Probably more yes. I could definitely see myself as a caring, maybe at times embarrassing father.
<br><br>
>>> (Laughs) Let me get going with the original question. 
<br><br>
(Thinking) I’ll definitely try to teach them the importance of respecting and listening to  what other people have to say. In this age of self-promotion, I think the most, or one of the most important abilities and one of the most underrated abilities is the ability to listen to other people. You don’t have to agree with them, but at least listen. That is definitely something that I would try to convey to my children. And I want to show them the world and give them a broader perspective on life in that way. Show them many different cultures, yeah.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Okay. The first thing that would be ideal for me to see in the morning would be the rays of the morning sun. And the last thing I see before I go to bed… I guess that would be to see complete darkness (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Complete darkness?
<br><br>
Complete darkness.
<br><br>
>>>You could never live in the city. Or does that just mean closing all your windows?
<br><br>
>>>I mean, complete darkness is almost impossible to achieve in the city. 
<br><br>
Not in the area where I live. 
<br><br>
>>> (Laughs) Or does that mean closing all of your curtains? Is that what it means?
<br><br>
Yeah, that could be another solution to the lack of complete darkness. It’s easy to fall asleep when it’s completely dark. And I feel calm.. I don’t know why.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Well, I don’t think the happiest moments in my life are bounded to a specific event or situation. I think it’s more like a state of mind where I forget myself and become one with the thing I’m doing. And that can be planning exhibitions, playing music, seeing friends or family. The moments where I’m usually most happy are the ones where I feel most inspired and creative. 
<br><br>
>>> Can you give us an example? 
<br><br>
When I first arrived at the V&A, one week before I started my internship, it almost felt like a religious experience, walking through these incredible exhibition spaces with cultural heritage from all around the world. And by the time I reached the room with the Raphael Cartoons, I almost shed a tear, which has never happened to me before when looking at a work of art. So…just the thought that I was going to be a part of this incredible place was definitely something that made me feel happy.
<br><br>
>>>Very, very cool. What was the most terrifying moment?
<br><br>
I guess it relates to my happiest moments because I’m definitely most terrified when I have lost the sense of inspiration, or meaning. I guess…, when I was seven I was chased by a pitbull (Leo laughs) and that was not a pleasant experience either. But I guess in general it is when I have lost the sense of inspiration. I’m actually kind of worried about that.



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to become a mountain climber because I was very good at climbing trees. So, that was the next step. Well, I thought so back then. In my primary school I wanted to pursue a career as a film director, and an actor, and an author. So, in that sense, I think I have always been drawn to the creative industries. My aunt used to say that I had an ”<i>eclectic</i> range of interests”. That expression basically meant that she thought I was talented in more creative fields but not talented enough to turn them into a career. (Leo laughs). That made me work even harder to obtain my goals. So, I’m very thankful for her “encouragement”. Definitely. In a way she has fueled my desire to go into the art industries. Because I wanted to disprove her. That being said, I have a close bond with my aunt.
<br><br>
>>>What would you say to your childhood you then?
<br><br>
(Thinking)…I would probably say that you shouldn’t do something you hate just because other people are doing it. Like playing soccer. I used to play soccer in primary school… and I just did it because I wanted to fit in with the groups of boys in my class. And it wasn’t very fulfilling at all and I played soccer for five years. Now, I love playing soccer, but at that time I wasn’t very interested in it. And… yeah. I would tell my younger self not to pretend to like something that you hate just to fit into a certain group, you’ll end up hating yourself for it. 
<br><br>
>>>All right. And finally, what is your dream now?
<br><br>
My dream? I guess it would be to further develop my electic range of interests (Laughs) and… to give people experiences that are interesting and beneficial.”
