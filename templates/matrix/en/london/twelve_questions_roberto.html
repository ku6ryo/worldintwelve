    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：27　Years in London: 5 years<br>
     <br>  
   
Roberto was introduced to me by Sayaka. Roberto is just one of those guys that oozes “nice dude”-ness, and he was just that and so much more. Roberto first invited me to do some climbing with him in North London, at this location called The Castle (which was literally a castle filled with rock-climbing walls!). I was so out of shape I think I ended up pulling something, but it was a new experience. Then we went and had a burger, which was also an adventure because everywhere Roberto wanted to go was closed so we did a lot of roaming around Angel lol. It was also inspiring talking with Roberto on a variety of topics, ranging from five day diving trips in the Red Sea off Egypt where you’re living on a boat, to childhood memories in Italy, to being in cross-cultural romantic relationships. Yeah, good times! Roberto gave great, extensive answers to all questions, but if I were to recommend, they would be the month “Q.1”,  the images “Q.5”, the partner “Q.8”, and children “Q.9”.  So Roberto I will see you around, and I know you’ll come to Tokyo again! Or I can meet you somewhere around the world with Sayaka :)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  Well we’re here right now because all the other pubs were closed. (Both laugh) No, it’s next to my flat. It’s a nice pub. Don’t come here all the time. I used to come here when I first moved here. But Angel, I feel, is really neat. It’s kind of hipster but also sort of mainstream. I haven’t gone full-hipster. So yeah, I’ve lived around here since I’ve been in London basically, except for one or two years. I love the area. 
<br><br>
>>>Such a nice area.  One of my favorites. I just like the name, Angel, too. It sounds good.
<br><br>
It’s a good name. 

 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/roberto/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  So I would go to…oh, I forgot the name of the place it’s called right now. But it’s in Antarctica. It’s the main town. 
<br><br>
>>>Antarctica?
<br><br>
Yeah, so there’s one main...it’s like a base camp town in Antarctica. And essentially what happens is you get three months, no sorry, it’s around six months of summer. And then six months of winter. And during winter, no one’s allowed to leave. There’s no transport. So no one leaves. But then six months in summer, people come in. They do jobs and stuff like that. But basically if I can think of one place that would be it. 
<br><br>
Is that the tip? The only place that’s really at all civilized.
<br><br>
>>> Yeah. So basically there’s that place.
<br><br>
Right.　And then there’s loads of research stations but the research stations are tents with between six and 12 people. That place [the tip] has a couple hundred I think. So it’s tiny…but yeah. I’ve seen a couple shots of the sky there. Just the snow. And I’m a mountain and ice person. So for me that would be amazing, if it was covered and paid for and I could spend my money there and experience it. 
<br><br>
>>>You probably wouldn’t even spend your money. 
<br><br>
I probably wouldn’t spend my money, huh? I think there’s just mainly reading and going out…and trying not to die. Those would be the main things I would try to do.
<br><br>
 >>>Good answer after you have pictures of you bouldering, right? He is the true outdoor type, yes!!

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Yeah, it’s an odd one. I feel like I’m gonna give a cop out answer. Because I moved around a lot, I don’t feel close to any country. If someone asked me “what’s my home?” I would say my home’s in Italy because my house is there. My family’s there. And as cliché as it sounds though…Italy, I don’t feel like I’m spiritually close to Italy. I like elements of the culture and stuff like that. But no, I don’t feel like I have a place where I feel like, “this is my home country.” Or my home town, as you will.
<br><br>
>>>So then you don’t have one? No places you’re close to? 
<br><br>
Well I feel close to lots of places but no place I would say “this is home above all else.” If I had to choose, it would be Rome. It’d be Rome because I grew up there, my family’s there. My memories are there.  But at the same time, if I had to choose the happiest place…that would probably be Vermont.
<br><br>
>>>Vermont?
<br><br>
So I used to have a house in Vermont and we would go to holiday there as children. And…it was just blissful times. Sounds ridiculous but my sisters would go and you go and you pick raspberries, and go swimming and go to tennis camp.
<br><br>
>>>So it was summer in Vermont?
<br><br>
It was yeah, summer holidays. And that was when we were all kids and everything was shiny and new and nice. And then we stopped going, I think when I became a teenager, for various reasons. But I guess they are rose-tinted memories. That would probably be my happiest place.
<br><br>
>>> Okay. Interesting. I haven’t really gotten “happiest place” before but we’ll put that in there. (Roberto laughs)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/roberto/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
London. A pub, and drinking.  But not drinking in a party, in the crazy sense. Just proper, people just drinking. I don’t drink like they do here in London. But yeah, whether it’s sun or rain, you got to a pub. If it’s sunny, you stay outside and crowd up the sidewalk. If it’s raining, you stay inside. But without fail, after every day, you’ll get people in business suits, younger people, all these different kinds, just at the pub. With a pint of beer just chatting, socializing like that. It’s very, very London. There are pubs everywhere.
<br><br>
>>>Great. Would you consider that “the place” too?
<br><br>
 Yeah. 
<br><br>
Sounds good. So all the pubs and pub places.
<br><br>
>>>Pub and ports. Those too. But drinking is always a thing.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
 I’m trying to think what it looks like…if I had to change the Union Jack, you know what? I’d probably change it to kind of a Scottish-type thing. I like blue and white together. So we knock out the red. Essentially become Scotland.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, with the cross.
<br><br>
Yeah, I’d do that.
<br><br>
>>>Scotland with a cross? (Roberto laughs) All those English people are going to become furious!! 
<br><br>
<br><br>
(Laughs) Does that become Sweden actually? Because you’d have a white background and a blue cross.
<br><br>
>>>Sweden is the blue and yellow.
<br><br>
Oh, so it’d be wrong then, yeah. Now which one is the one? 
<br><br>
>>>Finland.
<br><br>
Finland. Finland’s the one, then. Yeah, sorry.
<br><br>
>>>But Scotland is actually a blue background with a white X so, the closest Norwegian flag would be Iceland. (Laughs)
<br><br>
That’s good that you pointed that out. (laughs) Yeah, I’m not a big flag person. Sorry. But I think I go for more simplistic. I quite like Japan’s flag as well. The white with the red circle, dot. I like simplicity. Minimalist. Yeah, I’d go for something like that. Two strong, bold colors with a minimal design element. Probably move away from crosses because everyone does crosses. So yeah, something like circles.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Swallowing a mouthful of salt water. I don’t dislike the ocean but that’s a resounding feeling I have of it.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, you were diving in Egypt in the Red Sea. (Roberto laughs)
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
The movie “<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_(2007_film)">Sunshine</a>”. In the movie “Sunshine”, they go in toward the sun [in space]. And there’s a platform where they look at it from that shades the UV rays. There’s a giant ball of melting fire. It’s pretty cool.
<br><br>
>>>Wow.
<br><br>
They kind of become obsessed with it. They— the captain of the ship becomes very obsessed with it. It’s even his last words while he’s dying, someone asks him as the sun is burning him alive. Yeah, that’s it.
<br><br>
>>>Wow, literally he saw the sun and he’s dying. Which leads to dying…
<br><br>
—Death 
Sleeping. (Pauses)
<br><br>
>>>Sleep is the cousin of death, they say.
<br><br>
Very comfortable.
<br><br>
>>>Huh.
<br><br>
I find the idea of it very comforting. (Pauses again) I like sleeping.
<br><br>
>>>You don’t like dying, right?
<br><br>
I don’t know, it’s a very unknown thing. Curiosity. Overwhelming curiosity towards death. Because if there’s nothing after death, I’d consider it probably as sleeping so there’s no negative to it. If there is something afterward, I mean, that’d be fascinating.


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
About myself? I think the future’s very dependent on the ratio of courage I have in addressing it. But I feel positive. I think people always have control of their choices, circumstances. Well not always—largely. Especially me, being in such a privileged position that I am. There’s no reason not to be happy with my future. So mold the bit that I will. In terms of mankind? I dunno. I think it’ll be interesting either way what happens. Will it go down the route that ideally I’d like it to go? Maybe not.  I don’t know if I tend to follow the masses in terms of the way they think. I think I do. I don’t know. But it’s too unknown for me. It’s too big a question for me to know exactly what’s gonna occur. But it’ll be interesting. I would love to be there to see it happen. Well, it’ll probably be longer than my lifespan. (Both laugh)




</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/roberto/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The most important thing for me is, once again, silly. It’s very personal but it’s being happy. Happy with what you do day-to-day. Happy with where you’re gonna go. Happy with your choices. And knowing you have the power to change them.
<br><br>
>>>You have the power to change that.
<br><br>
So you’re in control of your own happiness. I always hear the statement “you made me angry.” No one’s made you angry. You decided to be angry. Whether consciously or unconsciously, it was your choice to get angry. So that’s always struck me very much as “no one’s made you do anything.” You’ve always chosen to do something. If you think circumstances have forced you to, that’s fair enough. But no one’s made you do anything. You always had a choice. So that’s it, I think, psychologically, as well as just life-wise.   
<br><br>
>>>Same thing with happiness, is what you’re saying.

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 (Thinking)…Playfulness, happiness, and to a degree, common interests.
<br><br>
>>>We did talk about this. Those common interests, you said it’s okay if there’s a few things you don’t have in common with another person.
<br><br>
I think it’s tricky. I think that one of the beauties of a partner is spending time with the other person. And I think to do that, it helps obviously if you both enjoy doing similar things. So I think there’s a degree of independence that you both need in regards to doing your own thing and being independent. Being comfortable with your own time. And when you spend time together, it’s doing something that you both enjoy doing and that you can connect to. So I find shared interests to be a lovely aspect of our relationship. So what I look for in a girlfriend is yeah. Is there an element of shared interests. Because if we were completely different—if she loved shopping and going out and just eating at restaurants—yeah, and I enjoy eating at restaurants too but I’d struggle to do other stuff with her. So at the end of the day, if you’re just not spending any time with your partner, then it’s a no. Different people, different relationships. But my margin of threshold in terms of time spent is some time alone and some time with them. So with that you want to enjoy the time you spend with each other.
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/roberto/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yes. <br>
Children: No!
<br><br>
>>>No?
<br><br>
Okay, so “no” is quite strong. I don’t know.
<br><br>
>>>You can elaborate. 
<br><br>
I could elaborate on the “no.” I currently don’t want children. And I don’t…I’m not concerned about the potential idea of not having children in the future. I think adoption is always a possibility if you do want to care for someone, raise someone. I think the idea of having an Indian girlfriend and myself as Caucasian-Italian, adopting a child of a different race would be amazing. 
<br><br>
A lot of people put a really heavy emphasis on blood relations. I’ve never really understood that. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe if I have a child,  the feeling will completely change and just connect but I think anything you know, you grow, and nurture and grow up with will be as close to you regardless of blood relation. But looking at where we are with our lives right now, what we want to do with them, the independence that we want, the financial freedom that we want to have, a child just doesn’t fit in. I think once you have a child it’s really that firm point where you’ve really taken a responsibility and you can no longer live for yourself. You’re sharing that life with a child which is a beautiful thing. But to be in that position, I think, you need to be a certain degree of ready. And it’s a degree of ready I don’t currently feel. So that might change, and if it changes by the time the biological clock for my girlfriend is a bit too advanced, then I think adoption’s a perfectly good option. And if it doesn’t change at all, and we’re happy and content, then I don’t think we need to have children. So, yeah. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Okay. I guess I have two stages. For “see”, the sappy answer, is obviously gonna be my girlfriend’s face, et cetera, et cetera. But “feel,” I guess is more interesting in that I think it’s the drowsiness before you go to bed. I love that sensation of just falling into a soft bed next to a warm…my girlfriend and everything else.
<br><br>
>>>Human. (laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah, warm human is a word. And just that slow descent into sleep. Or then sometimes the plunge where you just hit the bed and boom, you’re out. And waking up. It’s also that kind of gradual...just hearing the birds, the sun coming in through the window. Turning over, having that person next to you. That feeling of comfort, warmth. And I think the “bed safety.” It’s always a known factor. You’re always going to enter sleep and it’s always a comfortable, rejuvenating process. 
<br><br>
>>>Cool. Not just safety blanket but “safety bed.”  I never thought of that though. 



 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/london/twelve_questions/roberto/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Okay. Okay. I’m gonna skirt away from the whole relationship ones because I feel those are cliché but those are definitely there. (Thinking)…Happy moments? Yeah, there’s been a lot. Also a lot of terrifying moments. Okay, one of the happiest moments I had is I did a Coasteering. I went Coasteering with my girlfriend. And Coasteering is essentially you’re going to cliffs near the ocean and not high cliffs generally but some small cliffs. And you jump into the water and you come out with the swells. And it’s quite complex, actually. Coming out is more complex part cuz the tide pulls you out and the swells push you in. So if you’re not careful, you kind of hit against the rocks. Anyway, it’s not dangerous by any means but it’s a bit “iffy,” especially if you’re not comfortable with that element. And so one of the happiest things, I went to do that with my girlfriend and she was…the statement she made before she because I didn’t tell her what it was, was like “as long as we’re not jumping off cliffs, I’m fine.” So the next day, of course, we’re jumping off cliffs. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
It was a bit scarier than expected. Because it was cold and it was hailing. And you could see it—she was so terrified. But she just went through it anyway. And that smile that she had afterwards. That feeling of such joy that she’d been able to do it. And she enjoyed doing it. That was such a happy moment for me to be able to share, I guess my passion with her, and have her truly kind of hit that challenge, surmount it, and then be so happy about it afterwards. It was very happy for me. 
<br><br>
>>>>Very nice.
<br><br>
Terrifying? (Thinking)… It’s a difficult one. Terrifying. I think I guess I’ll choose one which is a bit boring in my mind. So this is terrifying for me—I’m not a big public speaker. I don’t enjoy speaking in front of lots of people, and I did something called Model United Nations. I went to Geneva. It was part of my school, and we represented a country. Wow. I don’t even remember the country I represented.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) My sister represented China.
<br><br>
That’s a pretty big country. No, I think we were something like Eritrea. 
<br><br>
>>> (Laughs) That’s pretty tiny.
<br><br>
In the general assembly, we were trying to declare war. We got Norway and Sweden and stuff like that to declare war on China. It became a joke. But anyway, I had to do the opening speech. And I had to do it to 400, 500 people in the assembly. And I went up there and I did that speech. And it was just… “Aaaah!!” I do. I hate public speaking. It was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. Just… I don’t know what it is. Don’t even rationally understand it. It’s something you can’t surmount. I thought about it logically. I don’t even really care if I come off as an idiot.  (Leo laughs) So why am I physically responding this way? I find it fascinating. I still don’t really understand it but the aspect of loads of people looking at you and you just all of sudden, everything you say becomes I guess… something where you’re dissecting every word? And your body just responds in an alarming way. Adrenaline gets pushed out. Anyway, I find public speaking terrifying in general. (laughs)



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
So my childhood dream was to become an astronaut. I’d tell that child now that…you probably physically might not become an astronaut now…that being said, I’d also say, your imagination, what you can do, and your experiences you can create will easily become replicable and transferable to many other people. What technology allows us to do now, basically. 
<br><br>
And what is my dream now? My dream now is to… cornily, be happy but live in as many countries as possible before I settle down in one. So what I wanna do is not just visit as you’re doing a little bit with your trip. So I know you’re visiting but the way you’re doing it, you’re living in each city. I wanna do that with countries and go to a country and work there for a few years and then switch. And then go to a different country and work there for a few years. And try to get a feel for the culture like you’re doing,  and then just living in different places. Because as I said, I’m a bit of a hermit. I fully envision that I’m going to live in the middle of nowhere. I wanna soak up culture and people as much as I can.
<br><br>
>>>Before you become the hermit?
<br><br>
Before I properly become a hermit and go in the middle of nowhere and enjoy my own company.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool.
<br><br>
That’s me.
