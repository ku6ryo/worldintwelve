    <p><span class="name">Jennifer O</span></p>
    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in Berlin: 5<br>
     <br>  

Jen was introduced to me through Genevieve. Jen is one of those thinker types—people I can relate with instantly because that’s what I consider myself to be. The thinker types usually do a lot of questioning (hence they’re thinkers) and it was actually kind of crazy because Jen actually re-questioned the first two questions of the interview haha. It was certainly a first. As you may have expect, I had an incredible time conversing with Jen, and we actually touched on a topic that has stuck with me even as I’m writing this. One of the most thought provoking incidents I’ve encountered in my year, it was regarding Jen’s work at the time consulting school teachers, and involving religious children and their hardcore (in this case extreme) faith at such a young age. It got me thinking about what it is to live in Europe, to be situated on a continent literally connected to hundreds of other nations (in some cases <i>completely</i> different culturally and economically), and that impact that has on not just your society, but even yourself, the individual. Yep. Deep stuff. So, again, as you might expect, Jen gave amazing answers. Every single one is good, and I would recommend you read them all, but if pressed for time, I would choose closeness (Q.2), images (Q.5), important thing (Q.7), and dreams (Q.12). So Jen, see you around, when I get back to Berlin!! I’m looking forward to more stimulating and insightful discussions! Yay!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
Yeah? So we’re at Görlitzer Park, which is in Kreuzberg, Berlin. It’s a good place to do an interview because it’s one of the only parks around here. It’s very thin. It’s a very thin park. It’s long and thin because it’s sort of built on the remnants of something which means that you’re very close to going back into the residential area. You don’t feel like you’re exiting the city to go to a park. It’s just like a through-way and I’ve got friends that live in that block and I work in that block. So this is like a common thoroughfare for me. 
 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/jen/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
At the moment, if you gave me 2,000 euros, I would stay in Berlin. I would probably…it would be very helpful, actually, because then I would have a lot more freeway, leeway, to look for another job in peace and calm without the kind of rising panic feeling that I have now. The reason why I left my job was because I wanted to do something that I really wanted to do. And now I might end up having to do something that I just do for the money because it is quite scary not having a job. But also because this… I spend a lot of time in Berlin thinking I would like to have the kind of money that lets me live the kind of life that I assume everybody else is living here, which is sitting in nice cafes all day, working on some kind of graphic design project, and going to really trendy parties wearing really nice clothes. (Both laugh) I can only assume that all of these people are tourists or sort of semi-short term or semi-long term tourists who come to do an internship and then go. But it seems like a nice way to live. I just can’t afford to do it.
<br><br>
>>> So you don’t want to go anywhere else? You have any chance to go anywhere in the world! 
<br><br>
Not at the moment. At the moment, the most exciting for me would be to have found a job that I love. And to get stuck in. I don’t feel the need to find out something brand new at the moment. I feel lucky to have lived in a city which has let me make a few mistakes and to flounder a little bit. And to take my time. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow. Very cool. I’ve never gotten that.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
(Thinking)…I don’t think there is one. I find it strange. Moving from one country to another and living for a considerable amount of time in both of them has basically—the only useful thing I’ve learned from that in terms of what a country is is that there isn’t one. There can’t be one. The country that I grew up in is so different to the country that I go back to for Christmas now. It’s just a holding ground. It’s changing all the time. Since I’ve lived here? The country that I am from has changed government in the past months. A lot of my friends have started sort of setting down lives, getting married, moving in with their partners. Our parents are edging into retirement. It just doesn’t resemble, really, the country that I associate with my childhood, which is quite a constant thing.
<br><br>
 And Germany, I don’t know. I’ve lived in Berlin for five years or four years. (laughs) Depending which answer I’m giving, and I’m constantly reminded that I live in Berlin and not in Germany. So which of these countries do I know? Neither of them. For that reason, I don’t think there is such a thing as a country that you can make a comment on.

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/jen/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I want to go with something pretty obvious, which is the TV tower. Fernsehturm. A, it just does represent Berlin. When people see it, they know which city you’re talking about which I always find quite interesting because I’m pretty sure that most developed countries in the world have TV towers. It’s not an obscure object and it’s certainly not pretty or glamorous or sexy or anything. For Berlin, it seems to work and people are very happy to represent the city. It’s also one of the only things you can see from wherever you are, but what I think is quite cool about it is you could orient yourself on that TV tower in that sense that you can walk towards it and you know you’re walking towards the middle. But if you actually want to find the TV tower, when you get within a certain radius of it, you can no longer see it. It’s really weird. The other buildings kind of cloud it because the middle of Berlin is the only place with tall buildings.
<br><br>
>>>Ah. I didn’t know that. 
<br><br>
So when you’re really trying to actually touch the thing, you often can’t get to it.
<br><br>
>>>Like a rainbow.
<br><br> 
(Laughs) Yeah, it’s really cool. Yeah, yeah. So there’s nothing more embarrassing in the world than asking somebody when you’re in the center of Berlin where the TV tower is. That’s just really—you should know that! Sometimes you just can’t see it anymore. So I think the TV tower. Yeah.



 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  First of all, as I said, I really don’t find flags interesting. It’s not something that… I remember flags I associate with at school, when the teacher would be out sick and you’d have a supply teacher, and they would be trying to think of a lesson to fill the gap and they would do something like “flags of the world”. (Leo laughs) And it’d be just so utterly boring. You know? And there was nothing that it was connected with. And you would have to. I always felt like I was guessing which flag was which and guessing. You know? You have to color the flags in and some shitty crayons and somebody’s using the red so I’ll just use an orange. You know? 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) That’s hilarious!
<br><br>
But if I did have to think of the German flag, well the German flag is… Okay, the German flag does not need to be redesigned because it would be pretty awkward to try and do that. If you were gonna try to redesign the German flag, people would assume whatever your intent was. You were trying to wipe away some amount of history.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, you’re right. 
<br><br>
The German flag seems to only come out once every four years for the World Cup, and ... And it’s a country which has managed to basically answer this question by itself by playing a sort of crucial role in forming the EU. And wherever you need to see some national pride, they pull the EU flag out instead, I think. That’s how I see it.
<br><br>
>>>Very interesting.
<br><br>
So, for example, on a lot of social development projects, like regeneration, you’ll see they were sponsored by the EU. The stars and the blue flag seem fine to me. I don’t think it needs to be redesigned. I wouldn’t want to.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
(Thinking)… I want to say something like… Hollywood. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Or words like that. Big American words because the ocean, nobody really uses the word ocean in the UK. You say “the sea”. And so the time where you hear growing up about the ocean, is in those big Hollywood films where there’s some kind of sentimental thing happening, I think. I mean, obviously as a child, I didn’t realize that’s what it was but looking back, that’s what it was. Like, oh! You know the film Andre? About the seal. Or Free Willy?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAGBn6PmnFU"> Free Willy</a>.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Any of these animal films where the animal ends up going back to the ocean. (Leo laughs) You know? It’s nature and it’s big and it’s meaningful somehow, and it’s somehow much more profound than the sea. When I think of the sea, I think of the shitty, cold, English, nobody goes on a holiday there. So I think of the ocean as something grander. A more American take on nature.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
(Thinking)…The sun. The sun. The sun. I love the word the sun. I think there’s a load of things that come into my head but it’s a real mix of literature, Catholicism, because my family tradition, and the Libertines is my favorite Indie band. (laughs) The Libertines, first of all, because they were like my teenage sort of <i>heroes</i>. Still are my teenage heroes. One of their most famous songs is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g207eTzVw0"> “Don’t Look Back Into the Sun”</a>, which is a perfect pop song. (laughs) And has a beautiful introduction and, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Don’t worry, I’ll put it on the site so everybody can hear it.
<br><br>
And it makes me—I mean the Libertines are great but “Don’t Look Back Into the Sun” in turn reminds me of Oasis, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8OipmKFDeM">“Don’t Look Back in Anger”</a>, and then I’m just in my heaven.  (Leo laughs) This whirlwind of heavenly music. And then also religion. I think of at school, we used to talk about Jesus all the time. We had Catholic schools. And color him in yellow and he would be somehow simultaneously a candle under the sun and anything that was exuding light.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. That’s incredible.
<br><br>
Yeah…And what’s the third thing? The sun. Oh, yeah. A line of poetry by I think it’s Wilfred Owen about the First World War where a solider has died and the line of poem goes, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/248354"> “Move him into the sun.”</a> And such a beautiful idea that a soldier has died and they are so clueless about how to bring him back to life and they’re so young. They’re 17, 18 year old boys and they said, “Move him into the sun.” And one of the lines is “The kind, old sun will know”. Just completely monosyllabic words, basic words. 
<br><br>
>>>The kind old sun will know. That’s probably as simple as you can get.
<br><br>
Yeah. As if that’s any kind of solution. I love that line. Yeah.
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death…(thinking). Back to the Catholic church. (laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>This time you’re not drawing Jesus I hope. (Both laugh)
<br><br>
This time, we’re not drawing Jesus but death is a word that I think that as Catholic children, you say much more than normal children do. Or you’re so used to it. You say it in so many prayers. You have an image and we had an image in every classroom I was ever taught in of a man nailed to a cross. If this was ISIS, this would be— we’d think that this was unsuitable for children on YouTube. You know? We block this out of our newspapers. 
<br><br>
>>>Very true.
<br><br>
These kind of brutal images and I was brought up looking at a man nailed to a cross. Dead. Or dying. So I think of the crucifix, probably.




 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
(Thinking) If I had to give a thoughtful answer, it would probably be quite depressing and that I’m quite worried about.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) I’ve gotten some very depressing answers. Don’t worry. 
<br><br>
(Laughs) Theoretically, I’m very worried about everything. On a local level, I’m worried about Berlin. I’m worried that too many tourists live here and they’re not thinking about the sustainability of their lives.
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) We were talking about this earlier.
<br><br>
Yeah. They’re not thinking. They’ve got no intention of having children, sending their children to any of the schools in the local area which will mean that the people that use the schools have to live further away and there will be all sorts of parallel societies building up. They won’t ever learn German. They won’t pay taxes. Blah, blah, blah.
<br><br>
And then I’m worried about the future of Europe. I come from a country which is basically threatening to leave since they joined. And I like Europe. I think it’s a useful and important thing. I’m worried about the future of the world because I know that there’s too many people living in it, and that the climate is basically increasing and everybody’s doing their best to ignore that. Because it’s too big to think about really.
<br><br>
>>>Yes.
<br><br>
And I’m worried about my parents getting old. And I’m worried about loads of things (laughs). But actually, my actual, gut feeling is just to take one day as it comes. I think it’s thinking about the future gives me these kind of anxieties, then I’ll try not to do it. Because the reaction would be to sit at home and hide, I think. And I don’t wanna do that. (laughs)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/jen/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The internet. (Leo laughs) The internet, without a doubt. 
<br><br>
>>>Elaborate on that?
<br><br>
(Laughs) (Thinking)… For so many reasons. First of all, a lot of my. I think the bit of my life I remember in the most detail start simultaneously as the internet sort of came into our lives. Just puberty, I guess, but 12, 13, MSN. It was when I got into writing. To have written conversations throughout your teenager years is incredible to somebody that likes writing. Now I can remember so many conversations just from how they were written down. I can remember songs in accordance with who had them as MSN names and MySpace. The color of people’s MySpace profiles. I think, for me, for anybody that’s really interested in communication or visuals, to have the internet as a teenager is just great. You can express yourself through images and songs. And curate yourself. I mean, we’ve got a cynical sense of that now but as a teenager, I loved it. It’s like having an additional bedroom. I thought it was great. A world that you can do whatever the hell you want with. 
<br><br>
>>>And that’s why it was called “the wall”, right?
<br><br>
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. As I’ve got older, I’ve needed it. Cuz I don’t know if I would still be living in Germany if I didn’t have Skype. Or if there wasn’t a way to make cheap phone calls. I could not imagine writing letters to my family. That would be the weirdest thing ever. What would we say? Nothing. (laughs) And also…(thinking). Just to have that much access to that much knowledge, to that much information. I think this is… especially I clear my mind because I’ve had to spend the last couple of months through my job defending the internet. We work on a lot of issues of radicalization and what the internet allows people to do if they have an extremist agenda. And it is scary and it does need to be considered. But in a lot of these conversations, I was the only one below the age of 35, and ever since, I was the only person that really, deeply treasured what the internet could offer. And therefore I’m willing to fight for— if it is to be adapted, that it stays essentially in the form that it is. That it’s flexible as a place. (Thinking) Yeah. The internet.
<br><br>
Oh, another one that I wanted to just quickly say is I just started a Kickstarter this week for the first time and that was another thing. I think people do the most horrible things, the most awfulest things on the internet. And in public, they save their nicest most unexpected moves for things like Kickstarter, where nobody can see what they’re doing. The people that contributed to that Kickstarter are people that I haven’t spoken to in ages and they didn’t even leave a comment or write anything. They just put the money in.
<br><br>
>>>Wow!
<br><br>
Yeah, and I was like, this is incredible! And nobody can see they’re doing this. These might be the same people that post Buzzfeed articles about nothing. And yet they’d do something like this where nobody has to know, apart from me. 



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
(Thinking) One of my friends told me last year that her parents, her dad told her when he met her mom, he knew it was the right person because it was a fair fight.  (Leo laughs) Which I think is really cool and that definitely has stayed with me as a really useful example. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow. So who’s this friend?
<br><br>
She lives here, actually. She’s from Illinois. And I like that. I think that I look for somebody who can have a tussle. Who you can grapple with. You can exchange. You can risk pulling out your strongest card. And they might have a stronger one. But no one’s gonna win. But no one’s putting each other down. But no one’s winning. There is competition, but it’s not to win. It’s mutually complementary. That’s what I look for. Something hard but sustainable. And also somebody who you respect and makes you want to be better.


  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/jen/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yeah.<br>
Children: Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. Regarding the fact that you said there’s already too many people in this world. 
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Okay. I’m not supposed to say things like that.
<br><br>
No, you can!  (Leo laughs) Actually, I was talking about this just last night. Yes.
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything you want to do with your children or is there anything, kind of image you have of them growing up?
<br><br>
Wow. (thinking) No. I can’t think of anything more abstract than having children.  (Leo laughs) I can’t imagine anything to do with it. The only reason it’s in my head, logically, according to things I also think about the world, it shouldn’t even be in my head. I know that it’s there, though, as probably a kind of biological— There’s a reason why there’s too many children in the world, right?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah.
<br><br>
Biologically, probably, we’re made to have them.  We’re more inclined to have them than not have them. But I can’t draw that picture at all. It’s just like when you have a dream and you can’t see people’s faces, but you have a sense that they were a person and not a car. Is basically how I see my future children. (Both laughs) Is this space of potential. 




</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 (Thinking)… My favorite thing, judging by what I’ve enjoyed seeing in the past… (laughs) Is, I like to wake up to see something that I have done. That sounds really weird but sometimes I write in the night. If I’m gonna write something, that’s probably when I’m gonna do it and that’s usually when I write the best kind of stuff that I think I’ve written. I tend to write stories or poetry, and if I wake up and can read back over it and it’s good, I really like that feeling. I think it keeps me… I find it nice to have something from yesterday being pulled through to today.
<br><br>
>>>That statement itself sounds very poetic! 
<br><br> 
(Laughs) Yeah! Yeah, yeah. I like that continuity, I guess. So something I’ve created is probably what I’d like to see.
<br><br>
>>>So that would be for both? Going to sleep and when you wake up? So you said what you wanna see when you wake up and you see what you wrote yesterday.
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Would that be the last thing you see?
<br><br>
Yeah, I suppose it would be. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) So there’s a connection.
<br><br>
Yeah. Yeah, it would have some kind of. I wouldn’t want the night to be completely dislocated from the day.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. That’s very interesting.
<br><br>
You know, because that I find quite scary when that kind of thing happens. I don’t want to be two completely different people. I like to see there is this freshness when you wake up if you created something the night before when you can see the mistakes and cut them straight out. 


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/jen/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. (Thinking) It’s funny. In terms of if there was a dial inside you that showed your level of happiness at the moment, and there was a way of measuring that like a lie detector. The chemistry that was going on in my body would probably correlate with something like music. In terms of the level of euphoria that you’re feeling or happiness.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.
<br><br>
So that would be any given point in my teenage years, any music event. Possibly… something to do with Pete Doherty and The Libertines. (Laughs) Where we probably there was a gig that we went to when we were like, 16 that Pete never turned up to because he somewhere lost in a drug riddled state close to Stoke. It was a school night, and we were quite far from home at that point. And the gig was canceled and then the following week, they put the gig back on. And they rang up the people that had tickets for the previous one and offered them first refusal. So we obviously took them. We went back and then when he came on stage, like a true, awful abusive lover, he was better for having made you wait. You know? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah! (laughs)
<br><br>
It was better for having messed you around. And we loved it and we were so happy that he was there. And how bad is that? It was probably worth him not turning up the previous time. And then I think as you get older, happiness happens for longer period of times with less clear triggers for why it’s there.
<br><br>
>>>I see.
<br><br>
So it’s hard to say because you don’t know quite what all the mitigating circumstances are because there are loads, I think. Not just music anymore. It’s… how you have a more relational understanding of it. You have, I think, a great sense of time. So now if I went on a really great night out tonight. I could probably only 50 percent enjoy it with the thought I still don’t know if I have quite enough money for next month. (laughs) You know? Which is something I would have never have had when I was 16, 17. Yeah. 
<br><br>
Most terrifying moment? (Thinking)… Most terrifying moment. It must be something like being on my own in a house. Or as a child, I was really scared of the dark and I had suffered from a really overactive imagination. Any noise was some kind of creature coming to get me. And I was very scared a lot of the time and any house that creaked or made a noise, yeah.  I don’t feel that scared anymore.  

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to live in America. It’s almost like a joke in my family because nobody quite knows where it came from, or why I had this obsession, but I really was absolutely obsessed with the fact that I wanted to live in America. And I sort of, at the moment, I can’t think if I just said it to be contrary because it seemed like such a far place away, and it was the kind of thing you could say to maybe be cheeky or provocative. But also probably had a lot to do with the kind of media we were consuming and…yeah, everything, every single thing, especially at that age. Because British or European film is generally quite indie.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah.
<br><br>
So you probably get into it as a teenager. You weren’t watching it as a kid. You were watching Sabrina the Teenage Witch.  Or Clarissa Explains It All. Or Kenan and Kel. Everything we watched was American and so it seemed like that was the place you had to go. That was where all the adults lived, anyway, and all the things happened. 
<br><br>
Now I would say to that person “that’s absolutely irrelevant dream”.  (Leo laughs)  It’s all the things, I don’t know, as I said earlier. I’m unconvinced that place, that location is really that important. Certainly the national location hasn’t got anything to do with how your life pans out. It’s the people and the decisions that you make within those parameters. So I would say don’t bother with that. (laughs) Which I haven’t done. 
<br><br>
And my dream now is to find a decent combination. (laughs) It’s completely unglamorous. But to find… at the moment, I’m quite tired in my head because I feel like I’ve got a kind of fruit machine situation going on, where they keep landing on different combinations. You could have money, a job, and a busy city. Or you could have a nice city and no money and lots of friends. You could have all these sets of threes and which one is the best one? When do you get the money out? When do you win? (Both laugh)  Yeah, so at the moment, it’s to find a decent one. One where you just don’t lose.
