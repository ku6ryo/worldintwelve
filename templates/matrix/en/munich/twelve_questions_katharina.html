    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
I chose it because you talked about where do you feel close to in this area here and this is first place that I’m thinking. “Oh, Victorian House is a good place to be a little bit… (thinking)…I mean, so for interviews, it may be a good place. Yes. I really love it.
 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/katharina/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Good question. I think it’s good to go to places where you’ve never been there. I think that’s good. I have my favorite places but, I would like to see, for example, Brazil, South America. Maybe I would like to do that. Yes.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. 
<br><br>
And to try to do the same what you’re doing. To ask people about real things, what they do, and what they do with their hands. For example, I’m interested in handmade clothes, or of folklore, as this folklore clothes, and how they do that. And could they earn money with this? Maybe to try to do this also for myself when the time is there, and I give them a little bit money for this. They could teach me, maybe.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, teach you their handcrafts?
<br><br>
Yes. It could be great. It’s going to be fantastic. I would love it.
<br><br>
>>>Is there any specific countries other than Brazil and South America?
<br><br>
I think maybe Argentina, is there a big city like New York? (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Buenos Aires? 
<br><br>
Buenos Aires. I knew Buenos Aires, but I don’t know. I would like to meet people there and I hope they would give me advance to go there, or to visit them. I think I would be full of trust to do that. I think I’ll meet the people with the open hearts who do this thing. 
<br><br>
That’s what I’ve been feeling everywhere. (Katharina laughs)
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Okay. New York is the city of my heart. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Oh, cool!
<br><br>
Yes, I was there for a very, very short time. Three months is nothing, but I felt so safe there. So… at home. So I can’t explain this, but it was a long, long [time ago]. My time was more for myself. Just going along. I did have contact with people, and I was still in this process doing something in my work with stylists and photographers. But the rest of this time, it was just for me. Just for me, myself, and I. (laughs) And it was so great to be there. Alone? Doesn’t matter. It was good to be there. I cannot explain this. I think there’s a reason is a circulation. What I really love is circulation of good thinking, and giving and taking. This is very easy to explain.
<br><br>
>>>Very interesting. When was this that you were there for three months?
<br><br>
2006. This was a long time ago. The last time, last year, I was there but very short. And it was very stressful. But I felt the same. I don’t know how to explain this.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
In Munich? Good question. Good question. Let me think. I think maybe, Eisbach. It’s a river. The Eisbach is quiet and small river. This is a “bach”. It’s more… at this English garden, and when you see the people there, they are very free.  They are so nudist and naked. They are a lot of people there when the sunshine is coming, they are so free. And yeah, the Munich is not so energetic, you know? They are not so “Waa!” and they need their time and they have to be [at a certain place at a certain time], but this is the place [referring to the English garden] where they’re “living”. (laughs) And they are…yeah. Eisbach is a good place to in summer, yeah. Or you are in a beer garden, and you see the people drinking, talking, and this acoustic scene is very interesting. A lot of people are there. A lot of sounds and yeah, it’s interesting. Beer garden is also good.

    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
If I could, I would like to… use maybe a lot of colors. I would work with…(thinking). It’s not so easy. (Thinking)… I really love art deco. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting.
<br><br>
I love this. (Thinking)… I think I would like to do like this. But maybe with colors in between, so not red. Not yellow. And not black. Some colors in between. I think it could be a good mix of what we are, together here, but it is a good mix. It’s a very good thing, but this is not so hard in other countries. Maybe we are able to live together with this thinking of… just fuck history and people when they decide to live in Germany, they decide to give them a new color. And new statement. Better words and better steps. This is a culture thing, I think. But we are a new culture.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool. So something that represents that. 
<br><br>
But art deco is more, I think, the style of [the flag]. I would like to give them a little bit more this direction. I think I really love it.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
(Thinking)… Yeah. This is… (laughs) a reaction of the ocean. I totally feel like I’m there when I have this feeling of “horizontale”.  I feel…(thinking)… I can’t find the words because I’m so close to this feeling, of “Okay”. That’s the feeling of “I’m coming to be there”. To be there, and nothing is important anymore.
<br><br>
>>>I see.
<br><br>
It’s more, yeah, maybe a feeling of freedom inside.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
The sun is energy. The sun is energy of everything. The sun is so important. So… (thinking) I’m thinking that… Okay, I come from Poland, and this is more the coldest place, or more close to the coldness. And I love to be in the part of the world where there’s the sun. And the people wake up with the sun, and they go to bed, they feel warm. But I think I am kind of a person who needs more the cold, the coldness. I love the snow and I love the mountains and always what the winter bring us but I don’t. To be in movement, to go out and to be instilling, and energy. Flowing and flowing. (laughs) I think I need the sun for this.
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death. (Thinking)… I am never afraid death.  (Laughs) I think death is the next… the new going. 
<br><br>
>>>I see. Yeah. It’s a cycle.
<br><br>
It’s a cycle. 





 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Hm. I think…(thinking) Yeah, we are very quick with everything in the future. We are so quick. We are losing the control for things. What we need to exist.  
<br><br>
[Katharina accidentally flicks the mic off her collar]
<br><br>
Yeah, for example, this. Technology. I think we are releasing control of things to be sensitive for…so okay. I’m not afraid of death, but I’m afraid the death of…(thinking)…the death of being close to people. The distance and closeness. This balance. Whatever I do, wherever I am, I want to have this feeling of looking at people and to be what, on the same step? And it’s not so easy, I know this. Because we have to be open hearted. And when we lose control but we are so quick with all the things in the technology, we lose the sensibility to create our moment. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. I understand. 
<br><br>
But, we are still in… I know this. I’m also a part of this. 
<br><br>
>>>Yes. (laughs) That’s part of this paradox.
<br><br>
But I try to watch, to control a little bit myself. But not so strongly. In some moments, I think okay. That’s over. I put away all the things from my body, all the electronic things… I try to see the things without having to take pictures of them. But maybe this differs what I have to do, because I’m also still in moments where I do pictures because I see things and I think “Oh, God, please help me to take it”. I would like to take it with me and to remind me of this time. And maybe this is better. Yeah, but this is not the answer to your question. (Both laugh)

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Okay a very important thing is to call my grandma once, two times in the week. And to ask her if she’s good and she feels good. What is she doing.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting.
<br><br>
Yeah. This is very important for me. But so to give you the answer… I think it’s for me, it’s important to feel satisfied about myself.  When I can go and do good things, and to say “okay, you give all what you’ve got, 200 percent. Do you think it was enough. Are you satisfied about yourself?” 
<br><br>
>>>I think, everybody can relate with that.
<br><br>
Of course, I want to be healthy, but okay. For health I do yoga and I think it’s great thing for that. And this is very important for me. Yoga.
<br><br>
>>>You were talking about movement before we started this. I thought that was a very interesting thing you were saying too.
<br><br>
Yes. Yeah, “Stagnature”. Is a very… I don’t like it. I think yeah, when I can, I try to stay still and move to change things, or to create, to find a new perspective for things.

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: That’s a beautiful question but I can’t give you the answer… First I have yet meet the right person. (laughs) But I think until now, I can’t give you the answer because this question with the child, it was always open for me. It was open because… this is not a question. I want to have a child, but the child would be the most important thing in my life. No, and the child could be the most important thing in my life, but I never did this step because I never met a man with the same…love? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. I get what you’re saying. 
<br><br>
I was in love though. I was in love with good…(thinking)…
<br><br>
>>>Good people? (laughs)
<br><br>
Good people. But… (laughs) it wasn’t enough.
<br><br>
>>>It didn’t lead to the child.




</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Okay, but I’m more energetic person, and I wake up and I need a coffee… and a short moment for myself. To open my computer, or to do yoga. But yeah, okay, that’s maybe just not possible when I’m not at home. When I’m on other places, I do yoga but I would like to feel whole. And but at home, I wake up and I need a coffee and I turn on my radio. 
<br><br>
Okay, very important thing in my life, I go back to your question is music! Oh! (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting. So music. That’s a very good answer.
<br><br>
I forgot! No, I never forget. Yeah, it’s music. Music is so essential thing in my life. 
<br><br>
>>>So you like to listen to music as soon as you wake up?
<br><br>
Yes, music but not so loud? The problem with the music is… never with the radio. The radio is not exactly what I want to listen to in that moment, maybe. But the music is the words of, fantastic words. Words are part of my inspiration also. Music is… but this is not answer your question! (Both laughs) But maybe it’s like this. When I feel good, I would like to have a match of music with this feeling. Maybe one hour later. But first, I wake up and think nothing. I think a “new day and I’m ready”. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>All right. What about before you go to sleep? The same?
<br><br>
Sometimes I’m in a conversation with myself. To be thankful with myself. I think” I go in” myself. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s a very cool answer. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten that one before.
<br><br>
And I would like to say thank you for… and take time for this. More and more. And then I’m Catholic, and Polish. And in this time a lot of people in my life, they bring me more spiritual things to practice. To go in yourself and to ask yourself “what is going on now? What do you wanna do?” Not really so in the future but maybe to say, what is now and what is tomorrow? When you feel you, yourself, your ground, your people, the people you love. Are you good? Are you still good? And to say thank you for this day. It was a hard day but I managed this, thank you. Thank you for your help. It’s good.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
This is a very… My happy maybe it’s better to… (thinking)… It’s not so easy to say. Hmm. (Thinking)… I feel happy when I’m being in nature. And, I feel very… yeah. It is a fantastic feeling when I’m closer to the nature. I am a city woman,  and I live here, and blah blah. But I feel so happy and I have a lot of beautiful moments with friends when I was in other places of this world. And I think… yeah. The most important moment, I can’t remember this so exactly. 
<br><br>
>>>I think you’re giving us examples, so it’s okay.
<br><br>
And I really love to be with my family but my family is… I love my family. But we are very different. I’m different. They are…(thinking) With all this, what they are, they are fantastic. But it’s been a very, very long time ago when I was with my parents. And I see okay, I have to change. I have to go… maybe, I don’t know. Two weeks is enough. (laughs) But, yeah. There’s beautiful moments with my parents, with my family, with my grandma. I love this. I’m full of love, and I’m full of good thinking. Yes, positive thinking.
<br><br>
>>>Was there a terrifying moment? 
<br><br>
I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe this is as I was a child, this was moment of… where are my parents?
<br><br>
>>>Oh, yeah.
<br><br>
And this is very interesting but I have a lot of friends with broken families. This is the same thing I hear when the children don’t get to meet their parents so much, and they’re so focused of them and they need them. And I don’t know. When I feel alone, something is broken inside, with these people. I have friends, they told me that until now, it’s a problem for them. To be alone, to be not ever feel really safe. 
<br><br>
>>>So you felt that way when you were a child? And that’s probably the scariest moment? 
<br><br>
Yeah, I think that… When we are able to work with ourselves, it doesn’t matter what it is. The moments of losing work, losing of home. Losing, losing… I mean.  Maybe a confrontation of something? That’s what, problems really with nothing.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I understand. Yeah.
<br><br>
I think, where is a problem when “we are here”. And in two weeks, something is in conflict with here and the people are on the street and they have guns and… okay. That could be a big problem for me. But I can tell you, it’s what I think is I’ve never been the person to say “Okay. That’s nothing. It doesn’t matter to myself. It’s not my problem.” I’m maybe a person. I have maybe more courage to go out and to think “okay, what a problem? Can I help? Can I do something?” When the people coming from everywhere now. It is not a problem for me in the situation to give my room to people from Africa. It’s not a problem for me. When this is a good thing. I can help. When I can help, I would like to help. I think the scary moment in my life is maybe to lose my home and my ground also. Or some kind of similar situation. The cozy situation is… [Katharina tries to find her word in German…]
<br><br>
>>>Destroyed?
<br><br>
Destroyed! (Both laugh)

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
(Thinking)… This is the problem with dreams but I dream about… not success in my work or maybe…. (Thinking) To be still and move. To stay still and moving. I mean, it doesn’t matter to be with friends and live in the good house on the river. Or my parents when they are old, they can be together, but they have to move with me. No, not the reason to say “Oh. They are old. I have to go back and have to [take care of them]”. (Leo laughs) No, no. My plan is to bring them where I am, and to give them the same feeling of vitality. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s very, very interesting. 
<br><br>
But I think there’s a better way to do this, like this, but the other thing to go to put them to the institution for old people. No, no, no. this is not a thing. When they are cool to see that the better thing is to live together on the place, with young people, with children, with animals. That’s the best way to go out from this Earth. To go –
<br><br>
>>>To the next place. (laughs)
<br><br>
To the next place, yes. (Laughs) And I think it could be a dream of mine, but I don’t have a dream, okay. Do you wanna know this? Yeah. I could be have a dream about material things. Could be a dream to…say when my car is broken, to have the money to have a new car. This could be good thing. So to be free! To go to stay moving. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, yeah. Of course. What was your childhood dream?
<br><br>
I think it was very, very full of colors of fantasy things? So more… I really liked to dance, and I think…the dream of something is to stay in harmony and to be in [that state]. So, not really changing… but also with contrast? I really love the contrast of living. In fashion, in art, in all the things, harmony is good. But it’s also a little bit boring. You need a confrontation. A confrontation with things in life.
