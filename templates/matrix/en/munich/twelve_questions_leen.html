    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：29　Years in Berlin: 6<br>
     <br>  

Leen I met through Olof, her boyfriend. I met Leen a number of times during my stay in Berlin, once at a club, once where I got to accompany her work as a tour guide (it was the “modern history of Berlin” tour. You can see the Holocaust memorial in the pictures below. Amazing tour, especially when considering it's “pay what you like“), and when we did the interview at one of the coolest cafe/community greeneries I’ve seen. Leen just has this vibrance to her (both figuratively and literally; her hair color even changed between the times I met, as you can see in the pics), and it was great times conversing with her on a variety of topics. Even looking back at the questions, I really felt like core value wise I could relate so much, that I was starting to wonder if <i>I</i> was answering these questions haha. So yeah, I’d love for the readers to take time to read each one, but if you’re pressed for time, I’d recommend the images (Q.5), the future (Q.6), wake up/sleep (Q.10), and dreams (Q.12). So Leen, I’ll see you again, and maybe you and Olof can make it out to Japan! Or we can meet in the US too, that works haha :)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
   Well, it’s not that often that we get nice weather. And so I thought it would be quite nice to be outside. This is kind of like a little refuge, I think it sort of sums up quite a lot about Berlin. It’s quite cozy. I actually used to work in a gallery just around the corner.  And Olof, my boyfriend, works about two blocks down. So quite often if we meet, we come and meet here. And there’s a huge art building where I can go shopping, which is sort of just nearby. So if I ever get a chance to come here, I do. I think it’s quite a nice mix as well. You see  all sorts of different people and they cook all their own food and it’s always vegetarian so I can always eat it and it’s got quite a nice vibe, I think. It’s like a hidden refuge next to a roundabout.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   From this point in time?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I guess. 
<br><br>
OK, because I often have a list that I tick down on. I would maybe go to Beirut. Yeah, it’s been kind of next on my list. I’d really like to go to the Middle East or even Baghdad which I think would be quite hard to get to. But I met a film producer from Baghdad and he told me that if you had sort of contacts there, you can still sort of get in there. It’s still a beautiful city and the history there is amazing. I mean it’s sort of the beginning of a huge amount of where our civilization comes from. So that would be it.…  I’m going to Detroit in September and if that wasn’t on my already plan of what I’m going to do, I would probably choose Detroit. After Detroit, Beirut.
<br><br>
>>> I read about a guy who tried to go to the 20 most dangerous places in the world. And he got into all of them. 
<br><br>
Yeah? Yeah, I think you can and where there’s a will, there’s a way. I think this media representation of the aggression of… I mean, obviously, there are areas that you don’t wanna go to. 
<br><br>
>>>Obviously, yes.
<br><br>
But I think if you have your wits about you and you’re not an idiot, then I think you can work it out.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Well then probably Sweden. I feel close to Sweden. (Leo laughs)  Like, that I have a connection to it?
<br><br>
>>>It could be anything.
<br><br>
I love Ireland because I just love the Irish. And I love the sort of rawness of the nature there. I think it’s such a beautiful country and they’ve also got a kind of quite crazy history and their culture. The storytelling and songs and they’re just, yeah…I don’t know, just the Irish. I always loved the Irish. My grandmother was Irish. And I’ve got a lot of Irish friends. 
<br><br>
Sweden I would say otherwise just because I have a lot of friends from Sweden and I really respect their gender equality and their generally more liberal associations.
<br><br>
>>>Societal maturity?
<br><br>
Their maturity. Yeah, they definitely do have that. I’m not that big a fan of sort of… the Swedish style, how everything’s perfect and clean and controlled and I feel very restricted by that. And so in that respect, I don’t feel connected to it. But it feels, for some reason, a bit exotic. If Olof and I are ever going anywhere and somebody asks where we’re from, as soon I say England, they’re like, “eh”. And as soon as he says Sweden, they’re like, “Oh!”  (Leo laughs) “He’s from Sweden?! I love Sweden!” (Leo laughs again) So, yeah. I feel kind of like we have that exotic connection, I guess in a way. So yeah, I’d probably say those two.

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/leen/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Okay…(thinking)… Yeah, that’s a lot to sum up in one.
<br><br>
>>>Especially being a tour guide knowing the entire city.
<br><br>
Yeah… I think Tempelhofer Feld, which is in the Tempelhof Airport. It was built by the Nazis. It was used during during the Cold War for the Berlin Airlift to keep West Berlin supplied. It is a place that the people now have fought for. I don’t know if you spoke about this before but in 2008, when they closed the airport, it was opened up as the public park and it’s the biggest open space in the city. I think maybe even in the world?
<br><br>
>>>It could be because it’s humongous!
<br><br>
It’s huge! And they decided they were gonna build about 100,000 homes on it. And there was a huge referendum and all the politicians, all the different parties, were voting for the development and the people of the city voted against it. And so from the people voting, we managed to save it as a green space.
<br><br>
>>>Wow!
<br><br>
And it’s a place where you get so many different people just hanging out. You’ve got the urban gardening, you’ve got people having their own sport, you’ve got dogs. Dogs are huge in Berlin. And it’s got huge big dog runs. 
<br><br>
>>>I already posted a picture on the blog where it was a guy who was doing wind sailing. On a board.
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah. It’s some crazy stuff that goes down there. Yeah, it’s a very nice place to have and when you walk to it. I’m from the countryside in England. I couldn’t live in London. (Leo laughs) Simply because it’s just so intense. There’s not really an escape from city whereas Berlin is so green and the route that I have from my flat to Tempelhof, if you walk down it, it’s just got an avenue of trees and it’s all sand and you feel like you’re walking to the beach.
<br><br>
>>>Especially East Berlin. It’s so pretty. The streets.
<br><br>
 Yeah.  I think green is very important for a quality of life. Residents in place.



 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  This is maybe, I’m just going on visual stuff, but I would probably change the red to pink. (Both laugh)  So it would be black, pink, gold. Because it’s supposed to be gold, not yellow. And I think if you had a black, pink, gold flag, that would be a pretty nice flag. I would definitely wear a top with the flag in it, if it looked like that (Leo laughs). I don’t really like the yellow and it just looks, I don’t know… a bit sterile.
<br><br>
>>>That would be cool.
<br><br>
Yeah, I think that’s what I would do to it.

 </p>

<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/leen/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
West Wittering? That probably means absolutely nothing to you. It’s basically, it’s a place in south of England.
<br><br>
>>>Is it near Brighton?
<br><br>
It’s not far. It’s kind of near Portsmouth a bit further down. You can actually see the Isle of Wight from it. We have been going there almost once a year, at least once a year, pretty much my entire life because my aunt and my uncle have houses there and it’s where we go for Christmas every year and it’s the one place where when I’m there, I just feel calm and relaxed and happy. From your bedroom when you stay with her, you look out the window and you just see ocean.
<br><br>
>>>Oh! Wow!!
<br><br>
Yeah. But you’re not talking tropical. You’re talking about south England.
<br><br>
>>>Sure, it doesn’t have to be tropical.
<br><br>
For me, going to the beach and looking at the ocean is wrapping up and putting on a scarf and the wind and it’s not about sunbathing. That’s what I think.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
 (Thinking)… I just think of sunburn. (Both laugh)  I think I’m just so vulnerable to the sun. I have a lot of freckles. I guess from my Irish descent. I don’t have a particularly exotic blood line. It’s Irish and English.  (Leo laughs) And that’s basically it. So I’m sort of very, very delicate when it comes to sunshine. I wear factor 50 on a regular basis.
<br><br>
>>>50! (laughs)
<br><br>
 Yeah. When I tour, I have to wear factor 50 because otherwise, I’m red by the end of the two hours I’m outside. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death? Oh. I just think of a skull and crossbones. Which I also kind of wanna get a tattoo of. I don’t know. I’m not scared of death. I feel like death has this really bad connotation…I don’t think about anything like a gory skull and crossbones. I think about maybe kind of a comic, kind of fun, maybe like Day of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.th/search?q=day+of+the+dead+skull&espv=2&biw=1424&bih=734&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiin4WWkNnJAhWXBY4KHeo1D8UQ_AUIBigB">Dead kind of skull</a>. I don’t know. I read a book, the last book I read, what was it called? …Oh, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Novel-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0312576463">“Freedom”</a>. Have you read it? Jonathan Franz I think it was? But it was really talking about…was it that book? Or it could have been another one. Anyway, about death being part of life. And I think everybody is so scared. I’m not really… scared of maybe having a long painful death that makes everybody suffer around me but yeah, actual just dying. 
<br><br>
>>>Yes.
<br><br>
I’m really not scared of that. I think one of the big things is that I don’t regret anything that I’ve done because I’ve kind of done anything I wanted to, as I wanted to do it. Whereas a lot of my friends, they’ve gone to school, to uni, to a job, and they’re kind of working on their future to then have all that fun and adventure.  And I imagine that they’d probably be terrified of about death.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah…
<br><br>
Very elaborated answer.



 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
(Thinking)… With all this sort of global warming stuff and the water supply, I feel like water’s gonna be a bit of a terrifying commodity. Revolution, I feel is maybe necessary. I feel that corporations, unless we can get corporations to actually have a heart, which, I don’t think as a corporation…I don’t think people who work for them are necessarily evil people. I just think the way that they’re set up and the way that governments are set up working with them, the people that come in, as good as their intentions are, they have such limited space within these set ups to actually do anything that’s necessary. 
<br><br>
Yeah, I had a little kind of sort of insight when I was on the train the other day and someone was saying how they would help somebody out if they knew them, but they don’t know them so it’s okay? And it’s that idea that you just keep in your own little circle and if it’s beyond your direct contact, then you wouldn’t change the way that you live. And I respect that people should have their choices in the way that they live, but I find a lot of people would rather stay ignorant because it’s easier. And it’s… it can really, you can really get drowned into all the negative. And I don’t think that the news is a healthy thing in a lot of ways because it’s so negative. Because you just feed on it and you start to feel helpless and depressed and… (thinking)… I feel as there’s a little light at the end of the tunnel. From the people that I surround myself with. For example, one of my best friends just had a baby on Friday. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh. Congratulations! 
<br><br>
Yeah! I’m gonna meet the baby tonight. I’m the godmother. Yeah, it’s exciting. But he never wanted to have children. Because he felt that, “I don’t want to bring a child into this world when there’s already so many children that need looking after”. And his plan was actually moving to South America to set up a children’s shelter and deal with some sort of organization that actually looks after the kids that really need help. So he was kind of shocked when this whole “accident” happened but now it’s a really— I was so sad when he told me that he didn’t want children because it’s people like him that should procreate because he will develop people with these values that will actually give better people to the world that we need. And yeah, I think in one respect, I sort of stay in my little bubble, but actually, by realizing, especially things through the techno scene, you see how many people all across the world have these values, and who are living their lives by their values. And that is bit by bit changing things.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Friends. And that’s not just family, I think my family are also friends. But definitely the people in my life.



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  >>>We talked about girls that a bit today…
<br><br>
A friend. 
<br><br>
>>>You’re connecting the questions.
<br><br>
(Laughs) But no, I think that’s one thing Olof and I were talking about this but first and foremost, he is probably my best friend. We have such a solid kind of thing, I think I feel I trust him just because of who he is, and just because of who I am. Something I think, maybe this is an idealistic way that a lot of people think about it, but he would have to do something incredibly out of character for himself to do something against me. And I think vice versa. And so just because we give each other that space and Olof’s incredibly good at trying to make me a better person. Just that sort of strong base of not expecting him to be something specific…. I think this is also something about Berlin is that it’s “un-Sweden”, which I see the difference when I’m in the UK. In the UK, when you have relationships, a lot of the girls I know, on Valentine’s Day, they want the guy to go and buy them flowers. (Leo laughs). “come on! What are you talking about? Why don’t you do it for him?”
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I agree (laughs)
<br><br>
All these things that the guy should do, or the way that the girl should be treated in the relationship. There isn’t that “I’m the girl and he’s the guy”. We’re two people in a relationship.
<br><br>
>>>Two partners.
<br><br>
Yeah, which is how it should be. I think people are a bit morphed by how society is constructed what a relationship is.

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/leen/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Not especially. I mean I’ve been talking about this a lot recently with people in the UK because it’s marriage season right now.
<br><br>
>>>Especially your age, 29, oh my God.
<br><br>
Everyone in the UK’s getting married. I had three weddings last year. I’ve got three weddings this year and that’s only the ones I’ve accepted to go to. But in Sweden, people don’t really do it. So I’m not really that bothered. It’s more the security of if I died or if something tragic happened, just to have that security that the “state things“ would protect us as a pair. That’s the only reason. I wouldn’t be against it but I would imagine it happening as a party in ten years. 
<br><br>
Children: Yeah, I really want children. 
<br><br>
[Second part of question]
<br><br>
Everything!  (Leo laughs)  I want to travel and go to places like festivals. I think the main thing that I want to give my kids is a broad mind. That they’re curious. I think curiosity and just an interest and not presuming “this is how it is in relation to me”, but just a curiosity to meet individual different people and to see the world in different ways. I just hate when people say, “well, they’re doing that weirdly”. We’re products of our environment.
<br><br>
>>>Exactly.
<br><br>
And to assume that someone’s doing it wrong or weird is just ignorant.  I think with just being curious and open, you meet some really amazing people who have these amazing views of the world that you can learn so much from.
<br><br>
>>>Exactly.
<br><br>
And diversity is the spice of life.
<br><br>
>>>Wow, great phrase. When you said festivals, do you mean musical?
<br><br>
Yeah. I think festivals are just in my view, and I think it sort of goes for anything. What you learn, you build up on yourself. So if you introduce a child to all these different kinds of people and all these different creations and all these different styles of music, they’ve got this incredibly broad creative foundation that they can only build up on. 
<br><br>
>>>Hmmm…Very true.
<br><br>
Yeah, it just gives you a better base for developing on.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 I’m gonna sound so cheesy (laughs)…Umm… (thinking)… I’m almost embarrassed to say but… Olof.
<br><br>
>>>That’s not embarrassing at all.
<br><br>
He’s very good at— not so much at night—but in the morning, he usually wakes me up just by kissing me all over my face.
<br><br>
>>>Aw!
<br><br>
Which is quite nice. And at night, yeah…(thinking) Yeah, I think it’s nice to go to bed. My mum’s very affectionate… I always used to get a good night kiss when I went to bed from my parents and I’d always say “Good night”. I used to share a room with my sister, or when I was at boarding school, I’d always share a room as well.
<br><br>
>>>Boarding school? Wow. 
<br><br>
Yeah. (laughs) So there was always somebody in my room to say “Good night” to. Saying “Good night” to a person. Yeah.


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/leen/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Happiest moment? (Thinking)… These are very vague memories but it’s probably being high with my friends. (Both laugh)  So I would have to say that. 
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. Just making sure this high is marijuana high, right?
<br><br>
Yeah, okay. High… marijuana high. (laughs) I’m not sure how well the legality’s going into this. (Thinking)… My happiest moment? (Thinking)… I mean the most recent one is Luca being born.
<br><br>
>>>Oh!
<br><br>
My friend’s. When he sent me a message saying, “it’s happening now!” And I was in the UK and I went to bed thinking “oh my God!” I couldn’t sleep I was so excited. And I think it’s the beginning of a whole new phase of everything. Yeah, that’s definitely a happy moment. I think, it’s just… (thinking) It’s so hard to think of an exact one.
<br><br>
>>>It’s okay. You’ve given us two already. (Laughs) I like your first one just because I’ve never got that one. 
<br><br>
Yeah? (laughs) The scariest… (thinking)… I remember when my little brother fell from… (thinking)… probably about four or five meters high and he must have been about three, four years old. He’d been wrapped up in a blanket and was trying to find his way out and he was on a ledge and he fell. I was sitting at the bottom and he fell onto concrete. And we thought he died. That was pretty scary. That was quite scary.
<br><br>
>>>Was he hurt pretty badly?
<br><br>
Well, he was just out for a good few minutes and when he came to, his eardrum had burst so he had blood just pouring out of his ear and we rushed him to hospital. I had him on my lap. I’m eight years older than him and I was holding him on my lap, driving him to hospital, and I was wearing a white t-shirt and by the time I got to the hospital, my whole t-shirt was red with his blood. That was pretty scary.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Okay. So my dream. I remember I always wanted to be an artist.  (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Ah. So you’re going along the lines -
<br><br>
 Yeah. I’m kind of going along the lines but if I could tell my childhood self now, it would be… I mean, it’s hard because I remember people telling me all the time to not be too idealistic. (Leo laughs) But I think I’m probably idealistic now as well but… (thinking)… I would probably tell myself to not compare with other people and to just do what I was enjoying. … Especially, and it’s probably the same in the States, and it’s probably the same in a lot of other areas of Germany, but when you’re surrounded by this whole society that believe, the way to make a successful life is to make a lot of money and to get a name for yourself. And you have people who are fighting that fight. People who have this insane drive in them and were doing all these various things and building up these portfolios or going to all these various courses and… I just liked hanging out a lot with my friends. (Leo laughs) And traveling. If I look back, I don’t regret anything I’ve done because I’ve had quite a nice balance, but I would get incredibly depressed and lost because I didn’t have that fierce-ful drive that so many other people had. So I just presumed that my future was going to fail. That I’d failed my future self because of what I was doing then, but actually it’s only now that I’m beginning to realize that…
<br><br>
>>> It might be the exact opposite, actually?
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s actually, you’re going to have a future no matter what happens. You just gotta get there somehow and it’s going to come so just enjoy getting there. Don’t sit on your bum doing nothing like these people who just really…. Yeah, sit on their bums doing nothing. I don’t really understand how they enjoy it. I just like exploring. 
<br><br>
I think my dream now is to continue exploring and to… (thinking)… I keep wanting to find out what it is that I want to do with my life but actually in a sense, it’s more interesting to not know because I end up getting myself involved with various other projects. Simply, because I don’t know.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool. 
<br><br>
So I’m sort of learning many different things. Yeah,  so to keep exploring and maybe believe in myself a little bit more.
