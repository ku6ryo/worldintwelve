    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    [Age] Lena: 26, Hagen: 30　[Years in Berlin] Both around 1<br>
     <br>  
Lena and Hagen were introduced to me through Anni. I had an evening meal with Lena and Hagen in one of their favourite restaurants, and this was cool because it was one of the few occasions where I was invited to a location west of Mitte, where I was staying. East Berlin and West Berlin have their obvious differences, and I could feel this in just the atmosphere and vibes of the residents. It was also fun talking with Lena and Hagen because it was right before they were about to have their baby, and this had an impact on some of the answers they gave. [Note: When talking with Lena post giving-birth, she said “A lot of the answers would be different now” which I thought was very interesting] This whole project was about meeting people at various stages in their life, and this one was one of the most significant. Both Lena and Hagen gave many great answers (idk, is it a Berlin thing to give thoughtful answers? lol), but if I were to choose a few, they would be the month (Q.1), the partner (Q.8), marriage/children (Q.9), and dreams (Q.12). So Lena and Hagen, it was such a pleasure talking with you, and I’d love to meet again, maybe when the little one is a little bit older…?? Haha, cheers!! 




</p>
       <br>
    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
Lena: Well, we’re at a restaurant called Arema in Moabit so a part of middle Berlin. And why is it a nice spot? Because it’s right around the corner of our place, so we just have good, cheap dinner here once in a while, I guess.
<br><br>
>>>Good cheap dinner. That’s all about Berlin. Right?
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah! (laughs) 
<br><br>
Hagen: Yes! Well, and they serve German food which is also kind of nice. It’s a restaurant, obviously. So yeah. (laughs)

 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/lenaandhagen/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Lena: Well, I think, well we have or I have some trips in my mind that I want to do eventually. But I don’t really have order because that has changed the last couple of months. Just because also we’re not, or I’m not by myself anymore.
<br><br>
>>>True.
<br><br> 
Lena: We are going to be three soon. So that’s also something that you have to take into account. But I think if I could take one month off, I would take all the books on my shelf that I haven’t read yet, and sit somewhere in Hawaii on the beach and enjoy the sun.
<br><br>
>>>That’s very cool.
<br><br>
Lena: With Hag, hopefully, and our little daughter. So. Yeah. It would probably be a little different when our daughter is actually born. I think then my choice would probably be a little more child friendly, I guess.  (Leo laughs) Right now, I guess for my situation, I would definitely choose that, I think.
<br><br>
>>>Okay.  And Hagen?
<br><br> 
Hagen: Well, I like reading too so I’ll obviously want to join you. (Lena laughs)
<br><br>
>>> Let’s say you were answering first though. (Leo and Lena laugh)
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah, then I would maybe have a different idea also. I watched a lot of tennis this last day so I definitely would want to go to Wimbledon one day and well, experience the atmosphere firsthand, I guess. So that’s what I’d probably do. And maybe we’ll do that next year.
<br><br>
>>>Wimbledon’s only what? A week or week and a half, right? So what about the other weeks?
<br><br>
Hagen: Well, I think there are also other things to see in London. So maybe that would be the idea to go to London. Be there for four weeks and do that around July. Visit the court and then see the rest of the city.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Lena: Do you wanna go first?
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah.  For me, it’s an easy one. I feel closest to the Netherlands, of course, because yeah, I lived there for five years. Also studied there. Have a lot of friends there. Also have Dutch nationality like that. That’s an easy one for me.
<br><br>
>>>Lena?
<br><br>
Lena: Well, I would have answered this question in the same way until very recently. It would always have been the States, especially California. But a more recent experience changed my mind at least for the moment, I already told you that I was in Stockholm the other month and I felt very comfortable there. Also very at home. It’s a feeling that is based on a couple of days, of course, but it kind of impressed me and I just liked the mentality and the spirit of the people. So I guess, right now, I’d say Sweden.
<br><br>
>>>Sweden is a very, very good place to raise children, by the way.
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah. That too. 

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/lenaandhagen/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Lena: Well, I would think the Tempelhofer Feld as a place, because it represents what people living in Berlin decided to do with their city. They were going to have this huge spot where you could just build buildings that are, yeah, designed to make a lot of money, or just working space. But the people of Berlin decided to leave it the way it is and make it accessible to anyone and every person that wants to go there. And so yeah, I think that represents Berlin pretty well. 
<br><br>
Hagen: Can I take the same answer? Or do you need a different one for me?
<br><br>
>>>You can say the same if you truly believe that.  
<br><br>
Hagen: I think that was a good one, yeah, and I heard that you have to live in Berlin at least for eight years to call yourself truly a Berlin resident, and now having been here for one year now, it almost still feels like a tourist, more or less. So that makes the answer a bit more difficult, I would say. But Tempelhofer Feld is definitely a good choice. So I think that, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>That in and of itself is sort of indicative of the city. The fact that you’re here for a year and you still feel like a tourist. That would say something about the city, I must say.
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah. Maybe that’s because you can do and experience so many different things. So maybe that’s it but in the last couple of weeks, I felt a bit more at home here. So it sinks in, I’d say.
<br><br>
Lena: For me, it was probably easier because I’m working and I just have this routine thingy.
<br><br>
Hagen: True. True.



 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Hagen: I don’t even know what the German flag stands for. (Leo laughs) I mean, the Black, red, gold colors. Do you know that?
<br><br>
Lena: No.
<br><br>
Hagen: I don’t know what it stands for –
<br><br>
Lena: Maybe that’s also because we don’t pay that much attention to the country restrictions and stuff.
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah, but… I’d say I like the symbol or the logo of the German national football or American “soccer” team, football team. 
<br><br>
Lena: That’s a nice one. True.
<br><br>
Hagen: We could easily take that one for Germany as a country also. I mean, just the black eagle. Yeah, you know that one. 
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah, I like that.
<br><br>
Hagen: I’d pick that one, I guess because yeah, Germans are already familiar with that one so.
<br><br>
>>>You two have a consensus on this one?
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah. 

 </p>

<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/lenaandhagen/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Hagen: The ocean.
<br><br>
Lena: Well, since I already—oh, no. We just have to say one word or?
<br><br>
>>>It can be anything! 
<br><br>
Lena: Well, it kind of relates to the first answer I gave. Just lay on the beach and reading. Yeah. Having the ocean up front and I guess. Yeah.
<br><br>
Hagen: Ocean is, for me, I’d say space. Like in, no boundaries. That’s what I think. This is something you can experience here in Berlin. No boundaries in a sense of no boundaries that restrict your individuality. 
<br><br>
>>>Hm. Is that open water that you mean?
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah! Open water, you see the horizon and there is no boundaries. No. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>That’s very interesting that you guys have two contrasting images of one person has the beach image and other has the ocean.
<br><br>
Hagen: (laughs) That’s true. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br> 
Hagen: The sun. Hm. Well there are obvious things, of course. Warm and hot and… I don’t know. Laughter and maybe a day outside. Yeah.
<br><br>
Lena: [Says German phrase] Or what’s the English translation?
<br><br>
Hagen: “Leading a happy life”.
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah. And that’s not the correct translation though but yeah, the life or the spirit that comes with the sun.
<br><br>
Hagen: An easy, happy life.
<br><br>
Lena: Easy going. 
<br><br>
Hagen: Easy going. Oh yeah, easy going is a good one. Yeah.
<br><br>
Lena: Easy going lifestyle.
<br><br>
—Death <br>
Lena: Oh, due to recent events, I guess it would be… saying goodbye and also accepting that a person or someone is better off and has their quiet time.
<br><br>
Hagen: Our dog died just recently just last week.
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah.
<br><br>
Hagen: Well, she was old already and then it’s actually also a good thing. 
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah. So she has her peace now.




 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Lena: May I?
 <br><br>
>>>Of course! 
<br><br>
Lena: Sorry. I think I have a pretty optimistic view about mankind in general although this is often challenged by shocking unexpected events.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. Cool! 
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah. I think I see tolerance just becoming more important in most of the countries and I think that is something that I, yeah, very much appreciate, of course. And that I feel is the right direction that mankind is actually going to. Although some countries are far from achieving this
<br><br>
Hagen: I think for mankind, in total, I think mankind gets better and worse at the same time. So in some countries, life gets better and better and others it gets worse.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.
<br><br>
Hagen: And I think it we’ll just have to wait and see. (Leo laughs) Of course, I’ll try to play a good and active part in this.
<br><br>
Lena: One could think that you are the realist and I’m the optimist. (laughs) 
<br><br>
Hagen: But that’s actually not true because I’m an optimist, actually. Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>So you’re saying that this depends on the country, is what you’re saying?
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah, I think so. Yeah. That it depends on which society, which country. Yeah. That’s what I think.





</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/lenaandhagen/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
THagen: For me, probably the most important thing is freedom, and being free. So for me it would be difficult, for example, to work in a job I don’t like and just because it’s so urgent and I have so much pressure to earn money. Then being miserable every day. So for me, I’d rather be free and have freedom than earning lots of money, for example. So I always choose the freedom part.
<br><br>
>>>All right cool.
<br><br>
Lena: For me…(thinking)… I’d say it is being happy. 
<br><br>
Hagen: (laughs) That’s also good.
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah. Just taking the day as it is and making the best out of it for myself so that I perceive that as a day that, yeah, was worth living and was fulfilling. 



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Lena: Oh, that’s interesting. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Hagen: What do you look for in a partner?
<br><br>
Lena: Oh, don’t feel uncomfortable. (laughs)
<br><br>
Hagen: No… (thinking) I think being able to be yourself, that’s the most important part. That you don’t have to well, be different than you actually are, right? And if I can have that feeling that I can just be the person that I am, daily, then I’m good. I guess.
<br><br>
Lena: Relates to the freedom thing, I guess?
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah. See, there’s the consistency.
<br><br>
>>>You’d be surprised at how people are subconsciously are very connected when answering the questions.
<br><br> 
Lena: So what am I looking? What’s the question?
<br><br>
>>>What do you look for in a partner?
<br><br>
Lena: (Thinking)… Yeah, I like what Hagen said. So you can be yourself, but I also like that at the same time, you have the feeling that you’re actually now living a life together although both have their own individual path. That you kind of feel that there is something that you are actually doing together or achieving together or experiencing together. So yeah.
<br><br>
>>>She has a good answer, too.
<br><br>
Hagen: That’s a good one, yeah. 
<br><br>
>>> (Laughs) Hagen, you’re just looking like, “I lost.” (Laughs) She gave a better one than me.
<br><br>
[Tangent discussion]
<br><br>
>>>No, that is very good. That’s very, very good. Yeah. Very cool. All right. So the next one will be another interesting question because it’s coming from Germany originally.
<br><br>
Hagen: It’s Question 8, right? 
<br><br>
>>>Number 9.
<br><br>
Hagen: So I think you have at least an eight to one lead or something? (Leo laughs) Good versus bad answer.
<br><br>
Lena: But it’s not about right or wrong. So.
<br><br>
>>>This isn’t math.
<br><br>
Lena: Exactly.
<br><br>
Leo: No wrong answers.
<br><br>
Hagen: Okay, I know. I was just kidding around.


  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/lenaandhagen/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
[Marriage]<br>
Lena: I do for myself actually. But I’m also not… it doesn’t have to be. So if it doesn’t happen in the future and if we decide not to get married, that’s fine.
<br><br>
>>>I see. So that’s one of those kind of decisions.
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah.
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah, and it’s not an option at the moment so we’ll just wait and see where it goes and then if…yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything that you want to do with your children? And is there this image of how you want her to grow up? 
<br><br>
Lena: Oh. Yeah, definitely. I think having a relaxed life where the child has all the possibilities that it needs and just has the freedom to live happy and, yeah. Have two supporting parents that are there, and just are there to experience stuff together and, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything you wanna do with them? Physically, or? 
<br><br>
Lena:  All the stuff we wanted to do before, traveling, museums, movies, art, talking to people, that’s still what we want to do or what I want to do. And at some point doing activities together this little fella wants our we feel are important to help her become the person she wants to be. 
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah, I think that’s a big part of it, that we said okay, we just do the usual things but then its three persons and not two anymore. If we decide to go traveling, then we’ll just travel as a family. Then one example we talked about the languages which we want to speak at home. And if it’s going to be Dutch or German or English or two or three out of these? And well we haven’t decided yet, have we?
<br><br>
Lena: No.
<br><br>
Hagen: But that’s one thing we want to do. We will make a conscious decision about the –
<br><br>
Lena: The language.
<br><br>
Hagen: The languages that we are going to speak, yeah.




</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Lena: May I go first?
<br><br>
Hagen: Sure.
<br><br>
Lena: Or no, maybe you should go first. 
<br><br>
Hagen: In situations I can, I usually sleep late, so well… What I like to see in the morning is actually that I’m—well, that’s it not too late, actually. (Leo laughs) That I still have a day in front of me where I can be productive and do things and yeah. So that’s a feeling that I don’t like in the morning. That I get up and then it’s already 11:00 or, that’s what I try to avoid, at least. 
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah, what I like least in the morning is when I have to look at my alarm clock. (Leo laughs) Just seeing that. That doesn’t make—well, not the most favorite thing to see, I guess. But for me, what I appreciate most, actually, is having Hagen around. Waking up and knowing okay, he is there. And yeah, I like that. And that’s also what I like when I go to bed. Well, recently, I fall asleep a little earlier.
<br><br>
>>> I hope so because if he’s waking up at 11:00 and going to sleep before you, he sleeps the whole time. (Everyone laughs)　　
<br><br>
Hagen: That’s true. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>What about you Hagen, for before you fall asleep? So now that you’ve had a productive day, let’s say. 
<br><br>
Hagen: (Thinking)…That’s a good one.
<br><br>
Lena: A TED talk? (Laughs)
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah, why not? That could be it. Now, what do I like? I think what I like before I go to sleep, what I want to see, what I want to experience, is to talk before I sleep. Just have a little chat and then doze off. So that’s probably a good thing in my life, I guess.
<br><br>
>>>Hey! You’re giving good answers too. Guess what? (Hagan laughs)



 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/lenaandhagen/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Lena: Oh, I have actually one that combines both. The happiest and the most terrifying moment of my life was when I found out that I’m pregnant. Well, not found out, but saw the ultrasound and saw that there is beating heart inside of me.  I just felt super happy but at the same time, I was just overwhelmed and felt so… That I didn’t really know what to do and what I have to expect for the next couple of months and after that. So that kind of terrified me but yeah, it was a very intense moment. I recovered from the terrifying part that turned into excitement about the future.
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) I hope so!
<br><br>
Lena: And now I’m just looking forward to it.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool. Very cool.
<br><br>
Hagen: I do remember it a bit differently because what I experienced at that moment was… I was really calm, I guess and just feeling and thinking “okay, we’ll be fine. We’ll be okay”. And so I say for me that was also the best moment but in a different way. So. 
<br><br>
>>> So it wasn’t your most terrifying, is what you’re saying?
<br><br>
Hagen: It wasn’t the most terrifying thing, no. I was quite –
<br><br>
>>>These are men and women differences I’m seeing. (laughs)
Lena: Maybe!
<br><br>
Hagen: Yeah! I think there is a difference to it because I have no bodily changes whatsoever, of course. So that’s maybe the biggest difference.
<br><br>
>>>Can you give us a terrifying moment? 
<br><br>
Hagen: The most terrifying moment for me? Well, when I was 19, I was applying for a job and I went in the assessment center and we had to give presentations. And I wasn’t prepared at all. And there was a room with 25 applicants and a psychologist and the chief of…I don’t know, an HR person? (Leo laughs) And I had to give a presentation or well, convince them that I would be the best person for this job. And I was super nervous and not prepared at all. (Lena laughs) Well, it obviously didn’t work out the way I wanted it. 
<br><br>
Lena: For the better, I guess.
<br><br>
Hagen: For the better, of course, but then I was thinking about that for one or two days after that. And I was so embarrassed. So maybe that was the most terrifying. A failure in my life.
<br><br>
>>>I mean, it stuck with you right now. First thing that came to your mind. 
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah.
<br><br>
Hagen: But then again, maybe there weren’t that many terrifying things that happened in my life, so I can consider myself lucky.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Hagan: Okay.
<br><br>
Lena: Oh. Yeah?
<br><br>
Hagen: Do you know yours?
<br><br> 
Lena: Yeah.
<br><br>
Hagen: Okay, I know mine too. You could start.
<br><br>
Lena: I think I always want to be a movie star, you know?
<br><br>
>>>Really?
<br><br>
Lena: Yeah, just being in amazing movies and being all famous and living in Los Angeles and stuff. (Leo laughs) I think I always wanted that. But well, there was the dream that I had but I never really put any effort into it because I knew that, I guess, I would never… that dream would never happen. So it was more that it…well, what I found that was most important was that it wouldn’t just happen unexpectedly. That from one day to another, [becoming a movie star] won’t just happen. What I would tell myself during that age, I guess, would be just be more realistic in a sense of really figuring out what I wanted to do. Not just live on what other people perceive as being a successful person. (Leo laughs) And live your life now and not just waste the time and thoughts and dreams that are not really your own. And just, yeah. Do something and live your YOUR life, I guess I would tell myself that. 
<br><br>
Leo: What was yours Hagen?
<br><br>
Hagen: Mine is quite similar. I guess I also wanted to be famous.
<br><br>
Lena: Tennis player.
<br><br>
Hagen: Tennis player, musician. That changed over the years a bit during childhood, I guess. But I’d say the same to our child and just enjoy the moment. And yeah. 
<br><br>
Lena: Oh, but what would you say to yourself?
<br><br>
Hagen: Oh to? Yeah. The same.
<br><br>
Lena: At that age.
<br><br>
Hagen: Just be like you are. Enjoy the moment and do one step at a time. Be present, I guess. Just be conscious. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. All right. What is your dream now?
<br><br>
Hagen: (Thinking) Well, we have this little “project”, coming of course. That’s one thing and the other? (Thinking)… What’s the other? I think I’d like to be a therapist one day but that’s a little more ahead in the future. That’s what I’d like to do. Be self employed and help others with difficult situations. 
<br><br>
>>>So practicing?
<br><br>
Hagen: Yes. Yes. So that’s what interests me, I guess. That’s for me.
<br><br>
Lena: And for me, I think it’s just living my life the way I do right now. I mean, it will change a bit, of course. But yeah. Just taking one step at a time and not making super extensive plans but just… yeah. Going mindful from the moment to the next one.
