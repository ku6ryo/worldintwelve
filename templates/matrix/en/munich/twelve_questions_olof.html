    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in Berlin: 4<br>
     <br>  
    Olof who is Swedish, was introduced to me by Lena. Hanging out with Olof really brought our the ”Berlin” in Berlin, if that makes any sense. He was really cool in that after being introduced, he just was like “You wanna hang out?” the following day. So Olof showed me around Gorlitzer park, we had Vietnamese food in Kreuzberg, and on a later day we went to one of his favourite clubs. He even gave me tips on which clubs to and not to check out (this is VERY important, crucial information in Berlin haha), and where to get good food. I mean, what incredible hospitality. I met a number of his friends too, and they were all so chill and nice people, it really proved what a great scene Berlin has going for it. For his answers, I recommend the representations (Q.3), the thing (Q.7) which was a first, partner (Q.8), and the moments (Q.11).   So Olof, I know you’ve been travelling all over the place, now it’s time for you and Leen to come visit me in Japan! Or the US works too :)  See you around!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Well this is Kreuzberg and what I think is interesting about this area is the park.  The church is beautiful but the park, I think it sums up Berlin very well anyway because you have... [crosstalk in German with a woman 7:10]
<br><br>
>>>Alright, you were interrupted but I think we got the gist. 
<br><br>
Yeah. It sums up Berlin in a great way because… first there's a lot of young people hanging out here, you're free to do whatever you want, no one really cares.  It's a great mix of people and you just feel like there's life here, walking here you feel that stuff, good energy is here.  What more can you wish for?
 </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   If I had two thousand euros I would go to the United States of America, because when I grew up, and the reason why I learned English in the first place was because of TV and pop culture.  So I've grown up on just as much American culture as I've grown up in Swedish culture, like what I consume day to day.  So music wise, movies, everything has been American.  You sort of know America in a way, or the United States, North America. But I want to see it because it's really fascinating.  It has the extremes of everything.  It's just sort of bananas and crazy and I want to… I've grown up with it, but I want to experience it, so I would go to the States.
<br><br>
>>>Where in the states?  Would you go the L.A.?
<br><br>
I would go… I would definitely go to L.A.  I would like to go to Detroit because of the similarities between Berlin and Detroit.  I think there is a lot of… Berlin  was a very empty city and I think that's why it's become so special today, because it was empty and there were a lot of opportunities because of that. And I think there's the same sort of situation in Detroit now, which is kind of a city that failed and there is no appeal to it. But that makes it attractive for some people who don't need much, like artists, or people who want to start something up and so I would definitely go to Detroit.  Also because of the interest in techno that I have.  I mean that's where techno comes from, so yeah. L.A., Detroit, then New York and Chicago.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  It's a really boring answer, but I think Denmark.  [laughs]
<br><br>
>>>[laughs]  Denmark? That's Sweden plus Germany divided by two! [laughs]
<br><br>
No, but they are very different.  I can't really feel connected to any other… You go to places, you experience them and there's similarities or things that you like, things that kind of click with your personality but…. So Denmark is like a better version of Sweden because Sweden is kind of strict and you've got to be a certain way and Denmark, people are just more down to earth and relaxed there, so it's like Sweden, but better.  So yeah, I feel connected to Denmark I would say.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Ok, this  might be a bit fluffy, but… let's say you're in Paris and you go in the subway and you stop at the station and there's loads of advertising and you can see that it is a structured, commercialized city, and that's just Paris.  If you're on one of the main lines (in Berlin), which is the U8, you stop on the Shorelines Plaza, and you look out the window there is a little, what do you call it, like a “display thing” there.  It's one of the most “trafficated” stations in Berlin and there’s a display there and the display is from a little shop just around the corner.  It looks like shit.  But they keep it alive and it's just a little shop around the corner when you get out there. And that would only exist in Berlin.  How come that they get to display their stuff in this super attractive—it would be super attractive for other people—place. But that sort of shows that in Berlin there's a lot of opportunities for anyone.  You don't have to have shitloads of money to get stuff done or to do something.  You can just have a little shop and have some display in the subway [laughs] and that, I guess, sums up Berlin in a good way.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  I guess it's not a dream I have, but…I think I would leave the flag alone because Germans, I think they have a bit of an issue with their flag. (Leo laughs)  I think it wasn’t until 2006 and the World Cup when they were allowed to actually show the flag, so for me to step in now and change it when they’re starting to get a bit more proud of it… that would just be rude [laughs].  I'm going to leave it like it is.  Let them enjoy.  I think they shouldn't feel ashamed or guilty for their past.  None of them had anything to do with it. I guess it's weird to be proud of a country as well, but if you want to do that, I'm not going to step in and take that from you.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Endless boredom.
<br><br>
>>>Boredom?  Why boredom?
<br><br>
There's nothing to do there.  I mean…I’m quite a social guy so, yeah. It doesn't attract me at all.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
Um…(Thinking)…Sun… Power.  Bet you haven't heard that one before.  Maybe… the future source of power, I don't know.
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Yeah, not so scary. 
<br><br>
>>>Huh…  Why is that?
<br><br>
I don't know.  I never really think about it.  I'm not scared of dying.  I don't want to die but… it's weird, why would you be scared of dying because when you're dead, there’s nothing…well, this is what I assume.  I have no idea what will happen but I assume not much is going to happen, so why would I be… I'm just going to be like boop [snaps fingers], it's over and there's not much to be afraid of.  It's not like I'm going to suffer.  Well at least I hope.  Maybe I’ll go to hell and it actually exists and yeah, then that would be horrible.


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Yeah, I'm hopeful and skeptical. (Laughs) Hopeful in the way that… I think thanks to the internet and all the development and technology sort of, really, really gives equal opportunity to everyone and it also sort of brings the world together.  That I'm super positive for, this sort of power of people all over the world being more connected.  That I think is a great, and it can be a great force for positive things to happen.  
<br><br>
At the same time… and I think hopefully it will break down, these sort of power structures that we have today. Its so boring to talk about, but we know that corporations that get too much power are bad for the world.  It isn't sustainable.  The nature of a corporation is not to do good for the world, and they have so much power.  Their nature is to, yeah, make money so that's what they're focused on and that they have so much power over us…that is worrying, I think.  But I’m more positive I think.  I think if the world can get more connected, we can change that.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Like physical thing?
<br><br>
>>>It doesn't have to be.
<br><br>
It could be a person, or...?
<br><br>
>>>It could be a person.
<br><br>
Hmmm…The most important thing.  Ok.  Maybe it's not the most important thing but one thing that I really love is my headphones. 
<br><br>
>>>Is your what?
<br><br>
My headphones.
<br><br>
>>>Your headphones?  [laughs]  That's such a great answer!!
<br><br>
Yeah, when you wake up in the morning you've got to go to work...  Working for two hours can really be boring but if you have headphones and there's something interesting to listen to it can, yeah, it can really encourage me to work. Or do anything, work out or.... it’s such a powerful tool in my everyday life I think.
<br><br>
>>>That's incredible.  You're the first person out of the seventy or something that I've done so far that's answered something tangible.
<br><br>
Yeah…Tangible?
<br><br>
>>>Yes, something that's an actual thing.
<br><br>
But you asked for a thing and so I gave a thing.
<br><br>
>>>Haha yeah!! We'll get back to this.  That's really cool.  Way to be original!! 
</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  >>>We talked about girls that a bit today…
<br><br>
(Thinks)…It's stimulation.  I don't mean like...sure, sexual stimulation as well (Leo laughs) but I guess I must say I think I have a really healthy relationship with my girlfriend and I think it's because we really… we bring out the best in people.  Being with her is always stimulating, our conversations or what we get up to.  So I think the important thing in a relationship for me is that it is stimulating but also, which I realize being with my girlfriend, is just appreciating each other.  She's really good at reminding me or, just saying thanks for small things that can easily become sort of “blase.”  She's really good at being genuinely grateful for giving her the toothbrush with some toothpaste on it and that I think is… yeah, you should appreciate each other.  That is healthy.  That makes a great relationship.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 Marriage: No.
<br><br>
>>>Not a possibility?
<br><br>
Possibility, but...
<br><br>
Children:  Yeah, yeah.  Think so.
<br><br>
[Second part of question]: (Takes a deep breath)… So hard.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Yeah as I said, the questions are supposed to get you thinking about things you don't usually think about! 
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah.  They do.  Yeah one of the really good things that I appreciate today that I maybe didn't appreciate in my childhood was that things weren't given to me…  I want my kids to figure themselves out.  If you figure yourself out, you don't get scared of trying out new things.  You develop your own sort of way of deciding what you think is good or bad or what you like, so just trying to let go as much as possible and let them fall and fail and be miserable.  The more miserable you are as a young person, the more you will learn from that, and benefit from that when you get older.  So give them a miserable life when they're young.  As miserable as possible. (Laughs) Just to make sure that they're happier when they're older...because you can be miserable when you're young.  You don't want to be miserable when you're old.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.  I hope you don't like beat them or anything, not like that miserable. (laughs)
<br><br>
[laughs]  No.  Not beat them!!!
<br><br>
>>>I know what you meant.  I was joking.  Don't worry.  (laughs)
<br><br>
[laughs]  Not beat them!!!



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
  Great thing to see when you wake up… [thinking]… well, let's start with the hard one.  Great to see when you go to sleep… that it's dark.  I mean that in the sense it's got to be night.  I can't go to sleep during the day.  Has to be night.  I'm very stuck to that sort of rhythm.  So when I wake up I guess it's great if it's sunny.  That makes me happy.  It's so rare, yeah.  It's not a very advanced answer but….that's it, yeah.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Happiest moment in my life….(thinking)….  Happiest moment in my life.  (Thinks more) Is there such one moment, I don't know.  What was the other one?
<br><br>
>>>The most terrifying.
<br><br>
Terrifying.  Most terrifying [Thinking… Hissing air… Making garbled sounds] I guess most terrifying is to… most terrifying…When there's something that you care about, it can be music or sports or anything that you care about and are sort of a part of a group which also cares about this, and then to step up and show what you can do in that group?  That is terrifying.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. Very cool.  
<br><br>
 [Here a homeless person asking for money to get on metro starts asks if he could switch some coins.]  
<br><br>
>>>Two fifty cents??  I don't have fifty cents so use my…I just dropped my money.  This wasn't fifty I think.
<br><br>
Nah it was twenty. Sorry 
<br><br>
[Homeless man leaves]
<br><br>
>>>Alright, that was your terrifying one. 
<br><br>
That is terrifying.  Happiest moment is when you do that even though it's terrifying and you accomplish it, you beat that fear and you come out sort of succeeding. I guess.  Yeah, that is the absolute most great feeling. 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Ok, I guess I have many but the one I remember because it became a thing, was that I wanted to become a stunt man.  Yeah, I wanted to become a stunt man, and my cousin and my brother really used this to their advantage (Leo laughs) by sending me downstairs and letting me try out dangerous things because they'd be like “Come on you gotta be a stunt man right? You gotta to learn how to fall!” What I would tell myself is, “it's going to change.” (Leo laughs) Don't think that what you want to be is what you want to be when you grow up. It's going to change.  
<br><br>
What I want to be now...what I really would like to do if I'm going to be honest with myself is… What I'd like to be…
<br><br>
>>>You don't have “to be”, it's just a dream or a goal.  
<br><br>
No, ok.  Then I would really like to live in Berlin and make a living out of music.  I don't know how to perform or make or produce, but I just want to be part of… I mean I really have a lot of passion for the techno scene and I'm into the electronic music scene in Berlin. And to make a living out of that by contributing to it, that would be a dream. And to have that as a base, and then be able to go and travel around the world and see other places, like explore and discover other cultures.  Yeah, that is the dream life I think.
