    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：41　Years in Paris: 20<br>
     <br>  
  Wolfgang was introduced to me by Mitsuhisa. Wolfgang is an architect in Munich, and he was kind enough to invite me to his studio. It was the first time I had ever visited an architect studio, and as a fan of architecture and interior design, it was an amazing experience. I was able to see the models, and some of the interns showed me first hand how they create designs on facades and ceilings. I also had a beer with Wolfgang and his employees during the post-workday meeting/debriefing session, where I heard various stories from the interns, some of them coming from as far as Japan and Nigeria. Wolfgang himself answered the questions with simplicity and wit—it became more of a conversation than an interview, and that was fun. The positive energy and confidence he held I admired greatly, and was something I felt I could learn from. For his answers, although I recommend all of them, I would choose the future (Q.6), the children (Q.9), the moments (Q.11—I am so jealous of his happy moment!!!), and his dreams (Q.12). So Wolfgang thanks so much for taking time out of your busy schedule, and maybe next time it’ll be Oktoberfest!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This place is our studio. It’s in the creative part of Munich and it used to be a factory for metal works and it’s now our architecture studio here.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
I would go to Italy and spend a month in Italy.
<br><br>
>>>Is there a specific part of Italy?
<br><br>
Somewhere… like around Tuscany.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting. I think I’m going to be going there. (laughs) There’s good sun and good wine.
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s very casual, and it’s yeah, just beautiful landscape. And it’s good food. Good wine.
<br><br>
>>>Have you done that already, also?
<br><br>
I did it twice for two weeks. And this was very relaxing.
<br><br>
>>>So it’s going to be a bit longer.
<br><br>
You just go cycling. You go eating, you go swimming. It’s just very relaxing. And you still have art and everything around. Museums around Florence or whatever. So that’s where I would spend the month for sure.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
The closest is definitely the United States, because that’s where I got all my education. Where half my family’s from.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really?
<br><br>
Yeah. My son’s born in New York. So.
<br><br>
>>>Oh. Does that mean you were in New York before you came? Did you work there?
<br><br>
I was in Munich. Went to New York and came back. That’s how I was. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I see.
<br><br>
So I went. I actually used to fly back and forth 20 times a year. (Leo is aghast, Wolfgang laughs) So that’s kind of where my second home is, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>I see. It’s in New York City. I’m assuming being in New York, New York’s a little bit different from say, the rest of the United States. Did you go to other places in the United States?
<br><br>
Um… (Thinking) There’s New York and there’s Los Angeles. And in between, I don’t really know. (Both laugh) No, no, I went skiing in Colorado so while I worked in Berlin, we were actually building a museum in Denver. So I went to Denver quite often.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I see. So you got some Colorado-ness but mainly New York.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
The best, I think would be the beer garden. This definitely represents the city and it’s very unique here. 
<br><br>
>>>True.
<br><br>
You don’t have it anywhere else. And as a place, the thing is well… The Oktoberfest as a thing, if you consider it a thing.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that’s interesting. Do you have a specific beer garden that you like? 
<br><br>
Yeah. I like the Viktualienmarkt very much, which is the old marketplace beer garden right in the center.
<br><br>
>>>Right in the center?
<br><br>
Yep. A good one is also the Wiener Platz. Very nice beer garden. It is unique because it’s the only place where you eat in a restaurant and you bring your own food.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<br><br>
You heard of this?
<br><br>
>>>Yes, I’ve heard of this. Which when I first heard it, I was like, that can’t be possible. (laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. But that’s where you go and that’s where everyone is sitting basically like working glass people direct aliance or whatever, they all sit together. And this also transforms into Oktoberfest which is a very important social event in Munich. So every company has to have reservations there, so you have to go with your client and everything. So this is really a social networking event. 
<br><br>
>>>Ah, beer garden. I never knew that. 
<br><br>
And this is very unique, I think in Germany, or in the world at all. 
<br><br>
>>>It’s almost similar to the Japanese Izakaya drinking culture. I don’t know if you’ve been.
<br><br>
No, last time I wanted to fly, the earthquake hit Japan, so my flight was canceled. So I had to change everything.
<br><br>
>>>You just bring and employ lots of good Japanese architects here. 
<br><br>
Exactly, yeah! (laughs)

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
The flag? The symbol is very good, currently. It represents the republic and 1848 ideas of democratic Germany. And the colors, unfortunately, are historically not good. (Both laugh) So… the colors would have to change. There’s a lot of countries that are very successful with their colors. Like America’s very extreme, successful flag. 
<br><br>
>>>Red! White! And blue! (Both laugh)
<br><br>
Yes. This was well done. And I would leave the three stripes are okay but definitely change the colors but hard to say which ones because all the good ones are taken by other countries. (Both laugh) So it’s really hard to say what’s the best color.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Fish.
<br><br>
>>>Fish? Why fish?
<br><br>
We love sushi! 
<br><br>
>>>We live in Munich which is landlocked! 
<br><br>
No, actually, we have an excellent sushi place here. And one intern who works here works at night in a sushi place.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, wow.
<br><br>
Yeah and whenever we have office meetings, we go there to the sushi place. 
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
Our extreme hot summer we had this year. The hottest summer, ever. And I don’t like the sun too much, which is very interesting because I like going to Italy but I don’t like lying out in the sun.
<br><br>
>>>That’s kind of a contradiction but (laughs).
<br><br>
Yeah. I like the light, though. The daylight of the sun, but not the heat too much.
<br><br>
>>>Ah, that’s interesting. That’s very interesting.
<br><br>
Because the sun gives extreme nice texture to buildings. Something you couldn’t do without. And the best light was actually in Colorado, because the sun, how close it is to the sky. Or you feel closer to the sky. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, it’s the mile-high city so. 
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah. And the light is different there. The sky looks bigger than in Europe, which is very interesting.
<br><br>
>>>That is very, very true. It’s the same as when you’re in Asia. The sunlight is completely different. It’s less direct, because it’s so humid.
<br><br>
>>>Exactly. Yeah. The best sunlight was in Denver, actually, I think. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
(Thinking)… Yeah. That’s sad. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) All right. No word. Nothing to describe it. 



 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Well, I think that everything will be much better.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, so positive.
<br><br>
Yeah, that’s solving all problems will happen, I think.
<br><br>
>>>Wow.
<br><br>
I’m very optimistic for the future.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a super optimistic view. Is there a reason why you think this?
<br><br>
Because people want to solve problems. I was travelling a lot. I have clients in Russia. I have a client in Iran, actually, which nothing happens currently. I built in Israel. And people are all very similar, and actually the people who work and are raising kids and making families. They all wanna be happy. That’s why I’m very optimistic.
<br><br>
>>>Pursuit of happiness.
<br><br>
Exactly. The exchange of cultures will lead to this. 




</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/wolfgang/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The family. Definitely. 
<br><br>
>>>Your family’s in New York currently?
<br><br>
Because they’re happy there. (Both laugh)
<br><br>
>>>Pursuit of happiness in that form, too!
<br><br>
Yeah, there’s the saying. “Happy wife, happy life” And this is definitely working. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>So they’re just there for vacation? 
<br><br>
They’re there for vacation, and actually, my kids started to speak too much German.
<br><br>
>>>So you’re trying to get them to speak English?
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah. Because my wife doesn’t speak German, so.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting.
<br><br>
She didn’t understand what they were saying.



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
>>>You could say business partner too! (Both laugh)
<br><br>
No, that’s you enjoy doing things together. This is very important. And that you also have your own freedom, so both like doing things together, but not sticking together 24 hours. Kind of having similarities but also opposite interests. This, I think, is very interesting and then things work out.
<br><br>
>>>I see. The happy wife, happy life.

 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/wolfgang/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
[Wolfgang is married and has three children]
<br><br>
They’re 4 and 6, and the baby’s just born, but one thing I’ve found is if you really want to teach them something, you have to spend time with them.
<br><br>
>>>Oh! (Laughs)
<br><br>
And that means, learning how to ride a bike, you have to spend time with them. And riding bikes with them. And they’re playing piano now, and which is very interesting that once they had a teacher, they weren’t really interested. But once I spent time with them, teaching them, then they got interested into it. And this is… the kid should learn a lot but you have to spend time with them, teaching them. And it’s not just purely you hire a teacher and then it works but they want to do it with you, and this is very interesting.
<br><br>
 >>>Is there something you want to do with them? Now that they’re 4 and 6. When they get older, is there something that you envision might be fun to do with your children?
<br><br>
Go skiing a lot, actually. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>That’s what I did with my father. (Both laugh) I see. Yeah, you have the Alps nearby. So.
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Better skiing here than in New York. If you go to Colorado, that’s where you to ski.
<br><br>
Hunter Mountain was horrible skiing. (laughs)



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 The first thing I like to see the sun when I wake up. That’s good.
<br><br>
>>>The sunlight?
<br><br>
Yeah. No, the daylight. Yeah. That’s definitely one thing I want to see when I wake up. And what feeling? I would like waking up the best feeling is that you’re not tired. 
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. 
<br><br>
Which not always happens. (Both laugh)
<br><br>
>>>That’s why its ideal. What about before you go to sleep? <br><br>
I would like to be exhausted before going to sleep.
<br><br>
>>>Huh. That’s interesting.You want to be exhausted at night but you want to be fresh in the morning?
<br><br>
Yeah. Exactly, yeah. And the best feeling is that you achieved what you wanted to do at the day. That you did something. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. Very nice. Thank you. This is also a tangent question. Do you design homes or it’s only bigger buildings?
<br><br>
We do every now and then, we do homes. But it’s far harder.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really?
<br><br>
Especially if you do it for a client. So if it’s not a public building, then you have to deal with the family. You have to deal with each person. How he wants his rooms. And it’s much harder. It’s much more intense in terms of work, because little things matter more than in the big buildings. Like moving a closet an inch is big impact.
<br><br>
>>>The reason I ask this is because I was wondering if any of the people want their bedrooms with sunlight. Or that kind of, those little things. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. You do have a lot of discussions. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>My room facing this way because then I get this kind of lighting. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Definitely.



 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/munich/twelve_questions/wolfgang/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
It’s very interesting. (Laughs) Because I’m thinking of my brother-in-law, and he was asked in an interview, “what was the happiest day of your life?” And he didn’t say his wedding. He said when Manchester United won the triple. (Both laugh)
<br><br>
>>>This is great! 
<br><br>
And this is definitely something that makes sense… I’m a fan of Bayern. And this was definitely one of the happy days, when they won the triple last year, or two years ago.
<br><br>
>>>Two years ago, yeah. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Being in Barcelona in the stadium and seeing them beat Barcelona, 3-0. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, so you actually went to Barcelona?
<br><br>
I went to Barcelona with the team actually, on the airplane, and this was amazing.
<br><br>
>>>How did you get on the plane?
<br><br>
I had friends who work for Bayern, so they took me on the plane there.
<br><br>
>>>Bayern-Munich. The team?
<br><br>
Yeah, the team.
<br><br>
>>>On the team plane?
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah. And this was definitely one of the happiest.
<br><br>
>>>Robben and Shweinsteiger and all those people? 
<br><br>
Everyone, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Wow! That’s up there, I must say. Wow! 
<br><br>
And the saddest was definitely when my brother’s baby died. So just before he was born, this was very sad.
<br><br>
>>>I see… Yeah.
<br><br>
This is a definite.
<br><br>
>>>All right. I don’t wanna…yeah, just was wondering if you’d say when they didn’t win. Was it four years ago, they lost to Inter, or something like that? (Laughs)
<br><br>
I was in the stadium, too. In Madrid, yeah. I was also here when they lost to Chelsea.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, yeah.
<br><br>
This was not fun (laughs)
<br><br>
But at least they won one, which was better than me with my Portland Trailblazers which haven’t won in like 40 years. Anyway.
<br><br>
>>>That’s true. (laughs)
<br><br>
Being an NBA fan is difficult. 



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
The childhood dream was actually to build things. 
<br><br>
>>>You’ve done it! (laughs)
<br><br>
So I think this has been done. (laughs) So I could retire now.
<br><br>
>>>You’d tell your child you, “I did it!”
<br><br>
Yeah. That’s definitely something I wanted to do as a child. Build.
<br><br>
>>>When you were a child wanting to build, was it anything? Or was it actually buildings?
<br><br>
It was buildings, yeah. Buildings but I didn’t know that you have to study architecture. (Leo laughs) Of course, I didn’t know this at all.
<br><br>
>>>You thought it was like building blocks. (laughs)
<br><br>
Exactly. Yeah. So I did drawings, and want this to be building something like this as a child. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. So you’re one of the few people who made your dream come true. Is there anything you want to do in the future? Any dreams or goals or? Build Olympic stadiums for Tokyo? (laughs)
<br><br>
That’s a tough one! (laughs) Tough commission. (laughs) This might be the tough.
<br><br>
It would be versus Zaha!
<br><br>
>>>She’s fired isn’t she?
<br><br>
Yeah. I don’t think the people were ok with a $2.5 billion stadium…  
<br><br>
No. A dream would be to build a football stadium for the World Cup. That’s definitely something I want to do.
<br><br>
>>>So… Qatar doesn’t seem like a possibility?
<br><br>
No, no! The best dream is actually to have the building in the opening scene of a James Bond movie.
<br><br>
>>>Oh!!
<br><br>
That’s bigger than the Pritzker Prize, actually. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, wow.
<br><br>
Because then the building’s famous then. It really means the building is important.
<br><br>
>>>That’s so true. I never thought of it that way. 
<br><br>
In the opening scene of James Bond movie. That’s definitely it.
