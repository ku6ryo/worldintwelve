    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in New York： 6 months<br>
     <br>  
    Arielle was introduced to me through Jennifer. Arielle, an art grad-student also working in an auction house, is one of those figures with an amazing sense of humor. You can tell this by reading her answers; she always has that one word or combination of words that gives an idea or thought that unique touch. I could also tell that Arielle has a very strong sense of her values, which I believe is one of the most important traits for a friend, and it was a lot of fun talking with her about art and the auction business (which I knew nothing about) at her favourite dive bar, amazing rooftop, and even her wonderful cozy home. For her answers, my favourites were the representation (Q.3), the flag (Q.4), her images (Q.5), and her partner (Q.8). Absolutely hilarious! So Arielle, thanks for a wonderful time, and I think I’ll be contacting you again because I have some interesting things I’m planning to do!! Haha

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This is my roof in Williamsburg, It was kind of my own little island. I come up here a lot . It's surprisingly quiet. You can hear some construction and trains. 
<br><br>
>>>Yes, you’re right it's super quiet!
<br><br>
Yeah there's just… its' not the typical street noise. 

</p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   I would go to Berlin. I went there once before when I was studying abroad, just for a weekend. And it was kind of shocking how at home I felt in a city I'd never been to. It was just the right type of vibe, very open people, art scene, cheap to live… yeah. The beer is cheaper than water. (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>It's much cheaper to live than here huh.  
<br><br>
Yes. Very much. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
   I feel like my easy answer would be Italy, because I lived there for a semester. But… 
<br><br>
>>>You there with Jennifer? 
<br><br>
Yes, I was there with Jennifer, that's how we met. But… I didn’t love living in Venice, it's a very, closed city. But that's kind of the only answer that I have. I haven't really thought about living in another country unless I lived in Berlin, Germany. I could see myself doing that. 
<br><br>
>>>So you could see yourself living overseas? 
<br><br>
Yes, I guess so. 
>>>Or at least Berlin. 
Yeah, yeah, it's very different, it's a unique place.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 The subway. It's not a place but… 
<br><br>
>>>You can have one of each so. Why do you think the subway?
<br><br>
Yeah, definitely the subway has kind of… that sort of thing, i don't know. Is it a thing or a place? I mean it's kind of both because you're standing there and it's kind of like… the cross section of the universe you know? There are all different kinds of people you've got people wearing Hermes and you've got homeless people… there's like nothing like it. (Leo laughs) You can eavesdrop on conversations, like I make a point not to be on my phone when I'm on the train because you miss out on a lot of interesting stuff.
<br><br>
>>>You listen in on people's conversations? 
<br><br>
Well, I'm just a people watcher so it's a sport for me which is really interesting. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there a funny conversation in particular that you recall overhearing? 
<br><br>
Oh it's fun listening to hipsters trying to talk about art or film. It's just interesting. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Ok, Great! Coming from Williamsburg which means you are on the L- train, which means you're in contact with a lot of that hipster stuff huh? 
<br><br> 
A lot, yeah. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   Would I do it? No. I'm not really a fan of symbols, they're kind of useless after a point  to me. I mean, I am studying contemporary art, so I have all of these theories that I can't shut off. So I wouldn’t… because it's a meaningless symbol, essentially. 
<br><br>
>>>The flag is? 
<br><br>
The flag is, to me. If there was an ideal, if this was me six years ago as a Freshman going to college and studying art, it would be something very fluid, kind of like a Rothko fuzzy edges and no hard lines but… time changes all of that. So I'm not really sure if I really have an answer for what my design would look like now. (laughs)

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
For the ocean, I recently saw these photographs by this Japanese artist and they were just so hauntingly beautiful. I mean they're just bodies of water but they're just endless and the perspective that they take. So that image comes to mind. 
<br><br>
>>>Who is the artist? 
<br><br>
…<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=hiroshi+sugimoto+art&es_sm=119&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIiIzk2_zlxwIVB5caCh1GyQ8o&biw=1423&bih=778&gws_rd=cr&ei=JRDuVeqGMIa3aafvgNgM#tbm=isch&q=hiroshi+sugimoto+ocean">Hiroshi Sugimoto</a>? I had the name written down but I can't remember the last name. I know the first name is Hiroshi. I just like them because they're so monumental and ominous.  …I’m probably going to relate to all of these as actual pieces of art. (laughs). 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Probably like, a beach side scene that's like super over exposed and you know, pale and bleached out and light—situation. I don't know (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>Bleached out…by the sun??  
Yeah, you know bleached out picture. Like when you're trying to take a picture on your phone and you can't really see what you're doing because of the sun… I don't know. 
<br><br>
>>>So the light of the sun.  
<br><br>
Yeah, just kind of like, blinding light, yeah. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death. (Thinking) A family together after the fact of the death. That's the image that I think of. (Thinking) Death effects obviously you know,  immediately the person that dies but obviously the people that are left. 
 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
For myself, just being surrounded by art and… thinking a lot about art, perhaps writing about it, communicating and expressing and interpreting ideas, so that's not really an image. But maybe a stereotypical librarian, image. Surrounded by stuff of interest. For humanity? That's a rough one. (Thinking) There are good things and bad things going on all the time, and it's just kind of a pendulum… so what?  How far into the future? You know, next week? The next election? It's a little too elusive for me. 



</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/arielle/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The most important thing to me is knowing that I've done a good job in school and in work and in relationships. Really just trying to make sure that, I’ve communicated, I've said and expressed myself creatively, which is ironic considering that i'm doing an interview (Both laugh). So yeah, just knowing that I've done well by people's standards. …I’m a type A and I'm a Virgo if that means anything. Maybe just a little. I tend to push myself really hard. I mean, today was a beautiful day but I was inside studying for three or four hours I just want to do a good job. Not just in a way that I just want to be successful and be the best. But if I got a B or something, it was like "I deserved that" - there was no question in my mind that efforts.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Must speak sarcasm. And pretty much…see I go to school with girls who are really into the three C's : cash, condo and car.  (Leo laughs)  I don't care.
<br><br>
>>>Wait is this for real? Cash, condo, and car??  Is this just a New York thing? 
<br><br>
Actually yeah I picked the term up when we were in Shanghai but it fit, because that seems to be a requirement. Yeah, our tour guide mentioned it.
<br><br>
>>>And you were like “this just fits my class mates”? 
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Finding a car and a condo in Manhattan is pretty tough… 
<br><br>
Yeah. Maybe they're universal shallow qualities. For me, it's just like, being able to banter, being able to argue, and challenge one another.   i have to be intellectually stimulated, that's pretty much it. I’m pretty consistent. …I once actually broke up with a guy because he didn't know who Jimmy Hendrix was——my mom wasn't pleased about that story. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow.
<br><br>
I mean it seems pretty shallow, but if I can't talk about…
<br><br>
>>>No no, I understand. He doesn't have to be a fan, at least he should have heard of him right? (laughs). 
Yeah it was a red flag, when we were watching film Slum Dog Million and he was like, “wow they're really poor huh?” 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/arielle/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
  Marriage: it's not a goal that I think about. It's not important, so yeah. <br>
Children: Naaaaa. I like animals.
<br><br>
>>>Could you tell us why? 
<br><br>
I mean it's never anything that was a desire for me. I just kind of want to do my own thing and when you have kids you… well, its just kind of “forever” so. 
<br><br>
>>>It is forever… Well you like animals :) 
<br><br>
Yeah! All animals!  



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
I think the ideal waking up scenario would be just a sunlit room with lots of open windows and not an alarm clock. To wake me up, just nature and circadian rhythms. A nice big apartment——that dream apartment that everyone has with how they would decorate it, with all of my stuff, all of my crap. (Leo laughs)  A lot of space and air.
<br><br>
 And going to sleep? (Thinking) Feeling just lots of blankets and feeling like you're rested before you go to sleep. Not going to bed exhausted. 
<br><br>
>>>Not exhausted… (Thinking). Is that the same as “not tired”? 
<br><br>
Yeah, maybe…not sleeping out of need, but just a peaceful drifting off…Like, ”Okay, I’m ready for tomorrow” kind of thing. 


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/arielle/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 I would say that the happiest moments that I've had… aside from getting into undergrad and getting into grad school…(Thinking) I was working at a non profit last summer and my kids, my participants—we call them “participants”— were putting up their art show, and most of them had just never painted before. So seeing how excited they were and their pride and seeing that they “made something”, that they could see the results of what they made. That's probably one of the happiest moments that I’ve had.  That meant a lot to me. 
<br><br>
For the other…I would say a good chunk of my teen years between 15 and the day I left for… well when I continued on. Just turmoil in my family, for several years in my life, it was just kind of constant. Not always one particular thing but just a constant state of THAT in Kansas. …Well I mean I also have some kind of funny terrifying moments. 
<br><br>
>>>Can you give us one? 
<br><br>
I almost got taken once. like Liam Neeson “Taken”, it felt like, in Shanghai. (Laughs) This guy just kind of cornered me and I was at the ATM and I was in the hotel, and he wouldn't leave me alone and he kept messing me up. And the ATM was in Mandrin and I was trying to switch it to English and I was just flustered and I start the process all over again and the first thing that it said on the screen once i got it switched over to English was "Do not be distracted by people while using this ATM".  (Leo laughs)  So I'm like “Well, this is the end. Alright, it's been great.”  (Leo Laughs)   So I just took out the smallest amount of cash that I could because this guy was following me at this point. So out of no where, finally tailor came from a shop in the hotel came and chased him out. 
 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
I always wanted to be an artist. I was always very creative. If I was cranky or out of sorts my family knew me well enough to provide a creative outlet, so I would just tried to be making things or telling stories and… what I would tell my childhood self in that dream now, is that it's ok to not be a "artist" but it's okay to be in the arts and supporting the arts and communicating art. And my dream now? I'm doing it now. It’s kind of cool. I'm studying it now so, and hopefully it will have an effect on someone, so. 
<br><br>
>>>Cool. So you would be a curator? 
<br><br>
Yeah like a famous curator, yeah! Look for me at the Venice Biennale in 50 years. (laughs)
