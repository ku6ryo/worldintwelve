    <p>Proflie: Age：21　Years in New York： 7 1/2 months</p><br>
    <p><u>Leo's Take</u><br>
     Avril is actually my second cousin. Avril is one of those people whom I guess we in society call “third culture”; although her parents are American and Japanese, she grew up in Germany and China, and spent years abroad in Chile and London. Wow. And this background of hers is what makes her way of thinking so unique. (You can see this in say, Q.1, where no one before or after has answered in her way.) It’s truly fascinating talking with someone who has an equidistant relationship and feel with so many different places and cultures, especially in this era where extremities come out on top and everyone needs their own specific, concrete niche.  All of Avril’s answers are thought-provoking, especially at the metalevel when you realize how much the concept of “identity” resides in each one, but if I had to choose, I would recommend her month (Q.1), her country (Q.2), her flag (Q.4), and her dreams (Q.12). So thanks again Avril, we’ll meet again, and maybe makes some good Japanese food together!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: Well, right now we’re on Broadway street, and this is probably my favorite--I know I know, maybe it’s really cliché but it’s my favorite street so far because it I like how it flows from the top of Manhattan all the way to Financial District at the bottom, passing through some of the most diverse locations in the city. My favorite building, the Flatiron Building, is actually on Broadway, just up 23rd Street. And school is only 5 blocks away, so this is really the center of where I spend most of my time.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   So, I think because I have been fortunate enough to travel all over the world with my parents, I actually would go to Portland, OR (laugh) because my parents just bought a house there, and they’re going to retire there, and I haven’t been able to spend more than 3 or 4 days there at one time. After growing up away from all my extended family, I realize how…I know this is like thinking way too ahead…. But I eventually want my family to live in close proximity to my extended family. That’s why I’d like to see what I think about Portland.  I think a month is a good amount of time to get a decent sense of the feeling of the place.
<br><br>
>>>Wow, I’ve never had that kind of an answer. What would you do with your money though? You have two thousand dollars.
<br><br>
Well. I heard the food in Portland’s amazing.  (Leo laughs) I love food. I’m all set on that. I don’t know, I mean…(thinks).  Yeah, really experience…But then I heard that Portland, Oregon is also a very outdoorsy place. So that wouldn’t require a lot of money either. It’s just like on my own.  Food--it would all go to food. (laughs)


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
   That is really hard. I… I don’t identify myself with one country. And… even though I lived in Germany for 12 years and  China for 8, I guess it still insufficient time to say with confidence: “This is where I am from”.. I went back to Germany last October actually while I was spending my year in London. And… I thought I would—after not having been there for 8 years, I thought I would get this overwhelming “I am home” feeling.  But… other than knowing the language spoken around me, I felt nothing.
<br><br>
>>> Oh !
<br><br>
…which was kind of disappointing.  But I mean a lot of people tell me it’s such an…being able to adjust to cultures and countries is a fabulous thing to have, but then again, you’re left with this “identity crisis”. And whenever someone asks me, “Where are you from?”, it takes me 20 minutes to explain. (Leo laughs)  But okay, then.  I guess a city, a country where I…?
<br><br>
>>>You don’t have to. That’s good. I mean, your answer’s great so far. Remember any of these questions, you could say, “No I don’t have one answer.”
<br><br>
Yeah. And then, I mean at school, when I first started in Chile or at NYU, I would say, I’m from Beijing. And they’re like, “Oh, but you’re not Chinese.”  And I’d say, “No I’m Japanese American,” but I guess I spent my teenage years there, and that’s… what I identify home … probably with. But then again, since my parents... I mean if my parents weren‘t living there right now, I don‘t think it would be Beijing. I guess home to me is wherever my family is. 
<br><br>
>>>All right. It’s a great answer.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 New York City ?  (Thinking) I think. Okay, thing, a thing.  The best thing that represents…the food scene?  Because there’s such a wide range, and it’s such a cosmopolitan city, and it’s not just…you have China Town and Little Italy, but there’s also this like conglomeration of all the cuisines.  I think that represents New York City as a whole. 
<br><br>
>>>I see. Is there a place? 
<br><br>
A place? Let’s see. (Thinking)… My kitchen!! (laugh) My Mom, since I don’t speak Japanese, she made an effort in teaching me a lot of Japanese cooking.  So most of my meals are a mixture between Japanese and then….  Mostly Japanese actually. My favorite--Oyakodon! (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that’s a very good choice. As long as you have chickens, eggs, and…
<br><br>
Leeks ! That’s all you need ! Yeah, and then. (Thinking) Yeah. I don’t know.  (Thinking) Yeah, I don’t have a certain restaurant, again, because I don’t eat out much. But I guess in my kitchen, I just try to take away from everything… (Laughs)

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   I think I have a very… skewed picture of what America is. I can only really say that I know New York City. So I think it’s this huge cosmopolitan place, international and everything, so I think the flag is a little…constricting. I think it should incorporate more of other places. Then again, there’s 50 some other states that also represent America. So, (laughs) I guess at this point, my ideal American flag would be…more colorful, maybe ? (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Same design, more colors? 
<br><br>
Yeah !  Maybe every star is a different color ? I don’t know. (laughs) Or maybe every star can incorporate a little something from a different flag. I don’t know. I’m not a designer. (laughs) To me, America is more of a…don’t they call it a melting pot? But maybe a cooking pot wouldn’t make such a good flag design (laughs).

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
First image, Cape Cod. We spent every summer…we spent 2 weeks every summer in Cape Cod which is 2 hours away from Massachusetts, and that‘s where my grandparents…or my grandfather now, lives. Growing up in Germany, we didn’t take a lot of trips, and so those few weeks we spent in the U.S. were always, my highlight. Especially going to the ocean. The whole concept of salt water was so weird to me, but (laughs). Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>I see.
<br><br>
Because we would go to lakes in Berlin, but never the ocean. And… Oh so Cape Cod and then there’s also Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. We would go there. Ocean, actually... Can I give you an answer--jellyfish! That’s it… (Leo laughs) My first jellyfish sting. That’s the bad association with ocean. The good one is Cape Cod, the bad one is jellyfish. (Both laugh)
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
The sun. (Thinking)  Never seeing the sun in Beijing. That’s what I’m thinking of right now. I think I’m never going to take it for granted seeing a blue sky and bright sun again, after living 8 years in Beijing. It’s amazing to me. 
<br><br>

—Death<br>
(Thinking) Well, does it have to be an image or memory or anything?
<br><br>
>>>The first thing that pops into your head.
<br><br>
Death. (Thinking)  It’s not something I think about a lot.
<br><br>
>>>Which also works.
<br><br>
Yeah. No, I…(Thinks again)
<br><br>
>>>So, nothing?
<br><br>
Nothing ! (laughs)

 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
I think I’m at a point in my life when I want to live in one place and really, I don’t know, kind of establish myself to a point where I can call one place “home”. And right now, in this moment, it’s New York, as weird as that sounds.  Everyone says it’s so claustrophobic and so loud and so busy. I agree with it all, but personally I need this constant buzz and vibe and…. Yeah ! I think right now my goal is to settle down, although that’s probably not what a lot of 21-year-olds would say. (laughs)  And of course I’d also like to explore my American heritage a little more.
<br><br>
>>>We’ll get to goals later! (Laughs)
<br><br>
Oh, in general ! 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. In general.
<br><br>
Oh!  I mean, hopefully the whole concept of …I’m taking Environmental Studies classes  right now. So hopefully, the whole idea of sustainability and leaving the planet the way we were endowed with it. And I don’t know, I like this whole health movement that’s going on in New York City. I think, I hope that will continue and… everyone be more conscious of their waste and everything.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/avril/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Probably a really cliché answer, but family. This is going to sound horrible but until I moved away from home at 17, family to me was something I just took for granted …But when I went to Chile for my gap year, I got the wake up call I desperately needed.  I had a very hard time for the first couple months---I was there because it was my first time away from home, it was a new continent for me, new culture, new EVERYTHING and I realized even if every other aspect of my life is being turned upside down, my family is always going to be there for me. And… that’s when I really realized I wanted to focus on improving my relationships with my siblings and my parents, and…. Yeah, it was painful… (Thinking) that period of my life was hard, but if I hadn’t had that, I would never feel as close as I do now with my family, and…. So, yeah, the most important thing is family, and…. Yeah!  And food. (laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>And food! 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 >>>You’ve met many nationalities! 
<br><br>
Yeah.I don’t think you have to find someone that’s completely compatible to you,  in the sense they‘re exactly the same as you and have….But I think, to me I guess our values do need to align. As in, we have to have the same morals. Family has to be first priority for him as well. But I don’t know. (Thinking)… I don’t want to narrow myself down to, “Oh I only go for one type and certain characteristics.”  But, they tend to be international. 
<br><br>
>>>That sort of makes sense.
<br><br>
Yeah. I think the whole mindset of people that have lived in the same town and the same state for their whole lives and people that have traveled is very different. It was, it was funny because during my first months at NYU’s London campus, I had such a culture shock to my own supposed American culture. It was like, “Who are these people?” And they were all from Tennessee and Ohio, and….
<br><br>
>>>Coming to London was their big first move away from home. 
<br><br>
Yeah. And it was just…they were 18, I was 20.  So I guess there was a little bit of a maturity issue too, but…. I fit in, in terms of like, I sound American and everything, but I had… I was just on a completely different wavelength than them. I did not… connect with them. It was hard. The first year was hard. Because we were in London, and then it wasn’t like I had New York City to explore on my own. So it was just my freshman group, and, I don’t know, I didn’t like my first year. (laughs)
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/avril/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 Marriage: (Very decisively) Yes. <br>
Children: Yes. And dogs. Dogs are a must!
<br><br>
Yeah. I think…I’ve been. I don’t know. I think I would want them to live abroad as well.  Maybe not to the extent that I have. I think 21 years overseas is a lot. (Leo laughs) But I can definitely see moving at least once or twice. And… (Thinking) I don’t know. It’s weird to think about hypothetical children. (laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>This question was actually given to me by a friend of mine who was pregnant at the time, and that’s why she wanted to know people’s answers from around the world! 
<br><br>
Oh, I want them to grow up speaking multiple languages. (Thinking)…Yeah, I mean I hope I’m fortunate enough I’ll be able to travel with them and expose them to different cultures.




</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
Well I remember while growing up, the best thing to wake up to was the smell of French toast or bacon (laughs) from the kitchen.
<br><br>
>>>Prepared by your Mother? 
<br><br>
Yeah. (Thinking) But right now… (Thinking)  waking up to sun (laughs) seems pretty nice, and… (Thinking) quietness, I think.
<br><br>
>>>Quietness?
<br><br>
Yeah. Which is hard to come by in New York City. You wake up and go to bed with the sound of sirens, constantly. But then again it just makes me appreciate it more when I’m back home in Beijing or when we’re traveling in the U.S., just quietness in general. (Thinking)… Yeah !
<br><br>
>>>What about before you go to sleep?
<br><br>
Well, when I’m back home, my dog sleeps next to me. So, my puppy, before I go to sleep. Yeah.

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/avril/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Okay. Now my terrifying one--that was… landing in Chile, my first time in this new continent, alone, meeting my host parents who I was going to stay with for a  whole year, and just being by myself I guess, and…. That was really terrifying—and not speaking the language. It just felt like I was plopped into this country, expected to live here a year and learn Spanish. That was the most terrifying! Happiest? Actually, I don’t, I don’t know if it’d be the happiest...
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, anything is good!! 
<br><br>
… Well last week, my best friend from Chile came…
<br><br>
>>>Oh Yeah. Josefina! 
<br><br>
Yeah. And she asked me to show her New York City, and I…walking around the city I felt proud of being able to call this home with confidence, and that was a happy moment for me...I was finally be happy in a place.  Like, I always---living in Beijing, London and Chile always felt very temporary. And this was the first time I feel like “Yes. This is my city.”  After only 7 and a half months, I know it, kind of. (laughs) But…
<br><br>
>>>Wow! That’s a great answer.  It has so much to do with your background.
<br><br>
It was just really nice having that feeling. Like she was in love with New York City, and I was in love with it too! It was…. I don’t know, I mean, it was like, “Yes, this is where I live.”  And it was, it was a happy moment. Happy moment. Yeah !

 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Okay. My childhood dream? I always…even though I had no idea what it really was, I always wanted to become a lawyer, (laughs) because both my parents are lawyers. But I didn’t even know what the law really was. I think I was just…I was one of those kids that just wanted to do exactly what my parents wanted me to do and make them happy. I still am kind of like that, but… (Thinking) I don’t know. They’re incredibly supportive and always tell me, “Do what <i>you</i> want to do and that will make you most happy.”  But I’m at this place where I’m so indecisive about everything that I just want them to tell me, like, “what should I do next?”. And…Yeah. So…and I always wanted to live in a brick house for some reason (laughs) with a chimney! (laughs).
<br><br>
>>>A chimney!  
<br><br>
(Laughs) and 2 dogs, because I grew up with 2 dogs. So, that was my childhood dream, to be a lawyer, live in a brick house with a chimney, and have 2 dogs.
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell that child you now?
<br><br>
…I could do with the brick house, and a chimney, and 2 dogs. (Leo laughs) I think I could. I would tweak it. I would change it to maybe a townhouse in Brooklyn, or (Thinking)… temporarily while I’m working, and then hopefully move to Portland.
<br><br>
>>>Oh!
<br><br>
I really… I mean from the 3 or 4 days that I spend there every summer, I think it’s the perfect balance of this vibe in the city,  and the food scene, having nature, and it has the high Asian population, which I like. And (Thinking)…
<br><br>
>>>Right! I mean, it’s really White. (laughs) You know, me growing up there. But yeah, I know what you mean haha. 
<br><br>
Yeah! It’s really interesting. That’s what I noticed coming, or moving from Beijing to London, was how Asian I feel compared to all of my American classmates. Whenever we were in the subway, and there was an Asian crowd and White one, I would gravitate towards the Asians. (Leo laughs)  It was so weird. And all my friends would call me really racist. “No, no. no.  But I’m half White. It’s Okay.” You’re like, No, you can’t say that stuff when you’re in America. (Thinking) 
<br><br>
>>>Then finally, so what is your dream now? 
<br><br>
My dream now is…
<br><br>
>>>You sort of talked about it before.
<br><br>
I think also finding…my… both my siblings have, have found kind of their own niche, by combining their academic skills with their hobbies and finding the perfect job for them., and ….Yeah. So if I could combine food, culture, languages, economics, all into one job.  That is a dream for me.
