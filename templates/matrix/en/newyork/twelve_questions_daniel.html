    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in New York： 4 years<br>
     <br> 
      Dan I actually met as a child when we visited the East Coast. My father was a friend of Dan’s mother, and while the adults did their talking, we children chased fireflies. Good times. Dan is part of PigPen Theater Co. which means he lives one of the coolest lives one can imagine. Some lucky people get to live by creating and acting in theater. Other lucky people get to live by creating and performing music in a band. Dan gets to do both. And you can see why. Dan is smart, funny, and a super nice guy--the trifecta for success!! Haha. We didn’t have the best luck finding places to eat while near his pad and studio in Brooklyn, but still it was a great time! PigPen’s basement just oozed with creative energy and...ok I’ll admit it. I’m jealous of their lifestyle lol. Dan, with his creativity and sense of humor gave great answers, all of which I recommend, but if I had to choose, I would say the flag (Q.4), the images (Q.5), partner (Q.8) which was one of the coolest ones I’ve gotten, and finally the dream (Q.12). So Dan, I know we’ll meet again, and do get your band on World tour!! Let’s meet up somewhere haha, but the US works too :)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This is the basement of my duplex apartment in Crown Heights where I and four of my roommates collaborate on music and write together. We're a band and a theater company, so this is where I spend a lot of my time. In this basement?
<br><br>
>>> Yep, you're sitting on an amp, and right next to the drum-set. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
Yep, proof of musicianship. (Laughs) </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/daniel/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 I'd probably pick a national park, and go…I think Glacier National Park comes to mind first, because my brother was there for a few months. He took some of the most amazing photographs I've ever seen and has all these incredible stories about backpacking for days at a time, alone. Then, waking up with a bear next to him.   That sounds great. I'd love to do that for a month. 
<br><br>
>>>Would you be by yourself or who would you be with?
<br><br>
I think it would be good to have one other person with me, maybe my brother if i could talk him into it. 
<br><br>
>>>He'd go for a second?
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Alright, great. 
<br><br>
Because, you know, a bear...if there's two of you, you have a chance against the bear.
<br><br>
>>>…Maybe.
<br><br>
Maybe. Optimistically.
 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 What country? That's tricky… I don't spend a lot of time out of the country, so . . .
<br><br>
>>>Any of these answers you can say “I don't have one.” That works too.
<br><br>
Yeah, I don't know if I do. I mean, I have the places where my family is from, which is like England, and Germany, and Russia. But, I don't feel a super strong affinity for any of those places. I've been to . . . I spent the most time outside of the country in Sweden and I really liked that, but I don't know if I can claim it as my own.


</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/daniel/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
(Laughs)…Um, well, the cynic in me would just say the rat in the subway station that I say hello to every morning when I get on the train (Leo laughs). We both kind of salute each other and go about our respective days. But, I don't know. For me, I always get the wide angle view of the city when I think of New York, I just think of that skyline. I lived in Queens for a few years and I had an apartment that was right on the river. I could leave my apartment and look out and see the skyline and I think that's probably the most obvious “thing”. But, that's what I think of.
<br><br>
>>> Is there a place or does that include the place?
<br><br>
Yeah, well specifically that would be Astoria Park overlooking the East River. 



 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   Hmm…(Thinking)… I think it could use a redesign. I don't know if I'm the one to do it. I don't claim to be a designer or a . . . what do you call it, a vexillologist, a flag person, but I feel like almost any country, after about 100 years, could dispense with all the symbols associated with it. Because they're so fraught with so many generally terrible things---kind of inevitably---that I think it's not a bad idea to switch out the representation every now and then. The American Flag . . . I don't know, red, white, and blue just feels boring. (Chuckles) Probably because it's the flag I've been seeing in the primary school classroom for my entire life. So, maybe we should do something like super translucent or something no one's ever done before. Cutting edge. Like, Google should design a flag (Leo laughs) or… a translucent fiber screen and it has the same GIF playing on loop of a bald eagle. Yeah, I think that would be great. 
<br><br>
>>>This was definitely the most high-tech one I've gotten.
<br><br>
Oh, yeah?
<br><br>
>>>I mean I was in San Francisco and no one gave me any of these high-tech answers. 
<br><br>
Oh, really. That's a shame, they should be way on top of that. 
<br><br>
>>>It's called imagination.
<br><br>
Yeah, that's right.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean <br>
(Thinking) Just like a…little scooter on a flat sea, no waves, just in the distance. 
<br><br>
>>>No waves?
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
Well, this is kind of cheating, because we're we’re working on an album right now, the title of which is “Whole Sun,” so I'm just picturing the album artwork we've been working on for this.
<br><br>
>>>The one I was going to see.
<br><br>
That's right, exactly, I wanted to show you. Which isn't actually the Sun so much as a mountain scape with a circular cut-out in the middle, which represents the Sun.
<br><br>
>>>Is it actually going to be a cut-out? 
<br><br>
No, I don't think so. I think it's supposed to provoke the shape of an LP, but I don't think there’s actually anything cut out. But, it's not done yet so I'll let you know. 
<br><br>
>>>We'll find out. <i>[And as we guessed, the new album <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pigpentheatre.com/whole-sun-lp">"Whole Sun" is out</a> now!!]</i>
<br><br>

—Death <br>
There's a graveyard if you're coming into the city from the North---if you're coming to Brooklyn from the North. Going along the BQE there's this big sprawling graveyard that's crammed in and around all these overpasses and stuff, so you literally are driving 10 feet over these grave stones. Yeah, there's something really disquieting about it, because it's always like… you can see all these graves and their silhouettes and then right behind it is the silhouette of New York, so you get the skyline and then grave stones. I don't know why but that always creeps me out. It's not the best thing to come home to.
<br><br>
>>>Wow, I'll try Googling this place. <i>[I think <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/travel/30weekend.html?_r=0">this is it</a>...]</i>
<br><br>
Yeah, I forget what the name of the graveyard is, it might even be a famous one. I don't know.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
(Takes deep breath) I feel like I'm more optimistic for my own future than I am for the future of humanity as a whole. But, also maybe . . . I don't know. There's nothing, you know, like any documentary you watch or article you read tells you it's way too late to stop the coming of global catastrophe---global warming and stuff. All of the scientists have this kind of like gleeful “zen” about it where they're all just like, “Yeah it's too late for us, but you know what, that's nature.” And, it's maybe a little cowardly of me, but I guess, like everyone else, I just think it's not going to happen in my lifetime. But, when I think about my own future I think about being able to do what you're doing. Being able to travel, more freedom, which again is kind of optimistic because...in general, I think the older you get more responsibility and it shackles you to various things. Not necessarily in a bad way, but we'll see. I should probably do all my traveling now is the upshot of all of that. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Well, you do go on tour, so that’s some traveling. 
<br><br>
That's true. I want to go to Europe and Asia, and all that stuff. So…we'll have to compare notes before I take my 12 month trip.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
    What is the most important thing for me? …(Thinking)…I think music, right now it is anyway. Yeah, just making music and listening to music and… letting that kind of seep into a very different part of my life…which music has a tendency to do. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow, music, wow. And you guys are technically a theatre company. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Right. The grass is always greener. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Well, she's just upstairs so I have to be diplomatic. 
<br><br>
>>>Don't worry I've done this when I've had both partners sitting next to each other .
<br><br>
Oh, really? Oh, that's good…I think I'm looking for someone who shares my sense of humor and who let's me make regretful jokes, and never apologize for them. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Well, I like that, that's pretty cool. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. She has to have thick skin, definitely. Someone to conspire with, that you feel like they're on your side and you can make friends and enemies together.
<br><br>
>>>Cool, wow. That might be the coolest answer so far for this question. 
<br><br>
(Yelling upstairs) And, I think I found her!!!  (Back to normal voice) Yeah, okay, we're good. (Laughs) 

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/daniel/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 Marriage: I want “the idea” of marriage. I don't know if it necessarily has to be marriage. <br>
Children: I…(starts to make a thinking sound)…That's a tricky one. It feels so hypothetical for me still, I feel like any answer I give isn't an honest one. Because, it's just not a part of my life right now. But, yeah, I mean . . .
<br><br>
>>>That's a great answer too. 
<br><br>
It's super equivocating, but it's the closest to the truth I think I can get right now, especially with (in a whisper) my girlfriend right upstairs. We haven't had this talk yet. 
<br><br>
>>>I hope she won't read it before. But, the thing is you just gave a very honest and truthful answer.
<br><br>
That's a true answer. She won't be able to hold it over me.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah you guys can talk about the details (Laughs).
<br><br>
Yeah. We'll sort it all out. We'll watch this together and we'll be like, okay now it's your turn to talk. 
<br><br>
>>>The video portion won't be going on till the end of the year, so you've got more time. 
<br><br>
Oh, okay, great. (Laughs)



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Yeah….(Thinking)…well…I think, just like day to day the best thing I could possibly fall asleep to would be a clean room and the sense that I accomplished the most that I wanted to for that day. But, that's like literally the most pedestrian road. (Leo laughs) I think I would love to see greenery before I fall asleep or just a landscape of some kind. I grew up in the woods, so I like falling asleep to the sound of crickets and a little breeze coming in through the window and stuff. Which we don't necessarily get here in the heart of Brooklyn. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, most likely not…
<br><br>
Yeah. But, that would be great. Then, to wake up just to something similar. I love waking up in tents.
<br><br>
>>>You did answer Glacier National Park for question one. 
<br><br>
Yeah. I really like camping and I don't get to do it much. I joined my brother for a short leg when he was on the Appalachian Trail this summer, and I joined him for a few days in Maine. Waking up in a shelter that overlooks a lake in the mountains is the best. It's just great. You don’t even need to talk yourself into waking up, you just  take a big breath and you're off. 


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/daniel/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Some of the happiest moments in my life have been performing, playing in a concert to a sold-out crowd. We did a show in Chicago on our last tour, at Lincoln Hall, that was the closest thing to a rock star experience I think any of us have ever had, and it was great. It was a drug.
<br><br>
>>>How many people came to the venue?
<br><br>
It was 600.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that's a lot. 
<br><br>
Yes. So, it's enough to…well, you're like “Look at all these people!” When you're doing something you love, you're sort of blasting past the usual insecurities (Leo bursts into laughter) and the voice in your head shuts up for five minutes and that can be an amazing moment. 
<br><br>
But also, times with loved ones. I remember I was really sick, when I graduated from college. I was really sick for a couple of months and then my sister got married. I was just sort of recovering and I was still kind of weak, but it was that kind of… cleansed feeling that you get from being sick for a long time and then getting to leave your bed for the first time in awhile. And, just being at my sister's wedding with my girlfriend and a lot of my friends, and seeing my dad dance for the first time, it was a real feeling, like I had a real community of friends and family. That was one of the high points for sure. 
<br><br>
Then, the scariest...(Thinking)…I mean, probably just when I was a kid, times when I thought I saw a ghost or something. It was literally the scariest. Yeah, I mean things like that… all of the fears of childhood I think had a pretty big impact. But since then everything's been less scary and more anxiety-filled. Which, I don't know which of those I prefer. I guess they both have their uses, I guess.




 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Well, I think I wanted to live adventures and I'd create larger than life experiences for myself. Which, I think drove me towards acting. Just growing up in the woods, running around, and hitting trees with sticks and pretending they were giants and stuff. I think at some point, that very childlike dream turned into, “well, there's a way I can do this and get to pretend all these incredible things.” Then at some point I think that turns into—the  drudgery of reality turns into an engagement with reality and that's really what theatre became for me. A really great way into seeing the world through that lens and not having to make it up as much. But, just looking at things in a way where you feel that sense of adventure and excitement. 
<br><br>
My dream now… I mean I'm really getting to do a lot of the stuff I wanted to do. I definitely never dreamed I was going to be able to tour in a band and play music that I loved. Well, at least not at this point and this far into my life. And I'm getting to do that. Really, the next part of my dream just entails making enough money to be able to keep living my dream. Because, I do think I'm living my dream, and I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell your child in you now? Would you say, in a way I am doing what you were thinking you want to do?
<br><br>
Yeah, I would say that and I would also say, learn discipline, or learn discipline sooner. (Both laugh) Because, I think I spent a good chunk of my life not really educating myself. I think I reached a certain point and I felt like I knew enough. There's a long three year fall where I realized I know absolutely nothing. I could have spent a lot of that time learning more, instead of crowding for the rope as it's flying through my hands. I would just say “study up kid.”
