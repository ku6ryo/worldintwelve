    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    [Holly] Age：26　Years in New York： About 3 years<br>
    [Alex] Age：26　Years in New York： About 2 years<br>
     <br>  
     Holly and Alex were introduced to me through my childhood friend Shaun. These two are basically what you envision a 20 something NYC couple from the west coast (Portland to be exact--REPRESENT) to be: laid back, chill, easy going, fun, visionary, open-minded, and most importatntly, following their passions and living the life. Holly has an amazing career as a interior designer, and also designed her own home, which was definitely one of the coolest pads I've visited. Alex is a talented music producer and track maker, and I have been a fan of his melodious yet heavy tracks ever since he was in university. Definitely check out their work below. I spent a wonderful time with the two of them, talking about life while nibbling on crackers, and I even went to a Blazers game with Alex later in Brooklyn (let me just say we will never see those Blazers again...as I weep in my pillow). Anyway, enought with tangets...so for the questoins, it was the first time I had done two people at once, and quite frankly it was a lot of fun. There is obviously much more of a conversation feel to them, and I think that can be seen when reading the text too. I recommend the representations (Q.3), the flag (Q.4), wake up / go to bed (Q.10), and the moments (Q.11). So Holly and Alex, I know for a fact I'll be seeing you guys in the spring next year...man I am excited already!!!

    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Alex:  We're in Bushwick right now and this is our home, so that's why it's a good place to do the shoot. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Leo:  Yeah.  Obviously very much where you call home, literally.  Okay, so what do you wanna do?  You want to go like this, this, this, this, this (Points between Holly and Alex)?  That works?
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah, we can do that.
<br><br>
Leo:  Well, if I have to say something before the other person, you have to just, I don't know, silently raise your hand or whatever.
<br><br>
Alex:  I can hear her answers, I can hear her answers first, so I don't make a bad call.
<br><br>
Holly:  (Laughs)  No, you first, every time.
<br><br>
Alex:  (Laughs)  Me first every time?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo:  Okay, I like that actually.
<br><br>
Alex:  All right.  Okay. </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/hollyandalex/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  Alex:  Hmmm….That one's so tough.  I honestly don't have a single place probably.
<br><br>
Leo:  You can do it as many places as you want if it fits in a month.
<br><br>
Alex:  But it's $2,500?
<br><br>
Leo:  Yeah. Spending money.
<br><br>
Alex:  Okay, it' like extra money?  Or like money, okay.  (Thinking)  I'd probably go somewhere in Mexico… like Tulea, maybe.  I do like the tropical thing, then I'd probably go down to Brazil, maybe backpack around South America.  It's kind of my ideal travel trip if I had extra money to spend.
<br><br>
Leo:  So you'd have basically a few days in each country?
<br><br>
Alex:  Uh-huh.  Yeah, it's always been a dream to go to South America.
<br><br>
Leo:  Cool! And you, Holly? 
<br><br>
Holly:  Paris and Tokyo, that's on my radar right now.  Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo:  Oh, you like the megalopoli!
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah, she's a city girl.
<br><br>
Leo:  I see.  Is there a reason for Paris and Tokyo?
<br><br>
Holly:  I went to Paris when I was a kid, and stayed at the Hotel Costes and I loved it.  And I want to go back and experience it as an adult.  And Tokyo, because I really agree and understand with the Japanese culture and I like it, and it's just always been on my radar.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Alex:  Mexico, not just geographically either.  My mom's from Mexico, so I spent a lot of time there as a child.  I spent…I’d go every summer as I child, I'd go to Mexico, so I feel very close to it.
<br><br>
Leo:  So that makes you half Mexican?
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah. 
<br><br>
Leo:  Oh, I never knew that.
<br><br>
Alex:  (Laughs)  Yeah, I don't look it, right?
<br><br>
Leo:  Yeah, I mean, I couldn’t tell by your last name too so. And you, Holly?? 
<br><br>
Holly:  What do you mean, the closest?
<br><br>
Leo:  Closest, obviously some people answer proximity.  
<br><br>
Holly:  (Laughs)  Canada.  (Laughs)  
<br><br>
Leo:  But yeah, in most cases, not proximity haha. 
<br><br>
Alex:  Or what resonates even. 
<br><br>
Leo:  Yeah, what resonates, like you said, Japanese culture.
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, I'm gonna stick to my guns, Japan.  I have this idea of what it is, and I wanna know if that's right.
<br><br>
Leo:  We seriously need to get you over to Japan. 
<br><br>
Holly:  (Laughs)  Yes, I'm a city girl, I love cities.
<br><br>
Leo:  If you love cities then Tokyo is the right place for you.  That place is— New York's big, Tokyo's huge.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 Holly:  The people.
<br><br>
Leo:  That was quick…and she broke the rules and went ahead of you, Alex!  (Laughs)
<br><br>
Everyone:  (Laughs)  
<br><br>
Alex:  She's a rule breaker, she likes to break the rules.
<br><br>
Leo:  So, when you say people, could you elaborate?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, I think the people make the city what it is.  Um…It's such a cultural hub, and it's so interesting, and the dynamic of how small the actual city is in terms of size.  I mean, Manhattan is only 12 miles long, and the nature of what that does to people, to be so on top of each other is so interesting. I think it makes New York very cool in that way.
<br><br>
Leo:  It's so compact, when you think about it.
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah.  You can't take my answer (looks over at Alex).
<br><br>
Alex:  I know, it was kind of stolen. (Everyone laughs)  I'll say, I'll say the hustle, I guess.  It's just there's such a hustle here that I've never, especially coming from a place like Portland where everyone just kind of chills.
<br><br>
Leo:  Yeah, the West Coast/ East Coast thing.
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo:  On top of that, the New York thing.
<br><br>
Alex:  And what it does to you, like how you change after living here for a while.  Because I feel like I've never been so involved in so many different things, and so inspired at the same time.  Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo:  That’s awesome.  Is there a place that you think best represents the city?
<br><br>
Alex:  (Thinking)…  I don't really think so, because to me the city is so…it has so many different neighborhoods and everything's kind of “compartmentalized”, and so many different cultures,  that I think that's what makes it the city.  There's not just one distinct place, it's all the places.
<br><br>
Holly:  And there's the subway system, too.
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah, the subway, I guess.  Kind of like... .
<br><br>
Holly:  Connecting all these people together, it's very interesting.
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah, it's kind of like the blood flow.
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, we can, we're in the Dominican Republic right now.  We can go right off to Flushing, Queens and land in China in five minutes. (Laughs)  So, it's very interesting.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Alex:  I already have an answer.
<br><br>
Holly:  Go.
<br><br>
Alex:  I would do a Native American symbol.
<br><br>
Leo:  Oh wow!  
<br><br>
Alex:  (Laughs) I mean, because… I've always felt very— I was a history major and I was always fascinated by indigenous cultures.
<br><br>
Leo:  You were a history major?
<br><br>
Alex: Yeah, and I've always been obsessed with Native American art and their very geometric design.  And there was a symbol I remember seeing, it was… it's like they had a sign, I'm not sure what tribe it is, but they have a symbol that represents the four directions. And I think that symbol I can see…  I think it's their tribal flag symbol, but I can see doing that in red, white, and blue colors. That's what I would do.
<br><br>
Leo: That’s so cool! Holly, would you do it?
<br><br>
Holly:  I don't think I would. I love our flag.
<br><br>
Leo:  Nice. 
<br><br>
Holly:  I'm gonna stick to, “no”.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/hollyandalex/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
Leo: The first word is “The Ocean”
<br><br>
Alex:  First thing that pops into you head?  A starfish.
<br><br>
Leo:  A starfish?
<br><br>
Alex:  (Laughs)  
<br><br>
Holly:  Glass.
<br><br>
Leo:  Glass?  …All right.  As I said, they don't have to be one word answers, you can make them one word.  That's pretty cool, too.  Okay, the next word is “The Sun”?
<br><br>
Alex:  Yellow.
<br><br>
Holly:  Icarus… Icarus.
<br><br>
Alex:  Icarus?
<br><br>
Holly:  Who flew too close to the sun.  Isn't that Icarus?
<br><br>
Alex:  I don't know.
<br><br>
Leo:  Oh, yeah, in Greek mythology, yeah.
<br><br>
Holly:  That popped into my head.
<br><br>
Leo:  Yeah, Icarus.  And he got too close and burned.
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, he burned.
<br><br>
Leo:  Hm, very interesting.  “Death”, is the final word.
<br><br>
Alex:  Skull.
<br><br>
Holly:  (Thinking)…  Fog.
<br><br>
Leo:  Fog?
<br><br>
Holly:  (Everyone Laughs)  Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo:  Is there anything you might want to explain a little bit about your choices?  There have been a few interesting ones.  Why fog?
<br><br>
Holly:  (Laughs)  I don't know, it's dark and mysterious, thick.
<br><br>
Leo: Very nice…mysterious and thick.  Why starfish?
<br><br>
Alex:  Well, this goes back to spending my child summers in Mexico.  We would, after it would rain, there'd be a big storm and it would push all the sediment down into the sea floor, and we would go out and we would look for starfish.
<br><br>
Leo:  I see. Holly, could you explain “glass”? 
<br><br>
Holly:  I guess, as a designer, I think in materials, and glass has such an interesting effect, and specifically blue glass, and it gives you an ocean feel.  That's how I feel.
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Alex:  I see a super tech-y world.  I mean, it's already heading in that direction, but… wearable technology.  Obviously like cell phones and watches, like the iWatch, whatever it's called.  I just see everything going in this super tech-y route… cars driving themselves, things like that.
<br><br>
Holly:  You mean our future, or?
<br><br>
Alex:  Our future?
<br><br>
Leo:  Give me both, I usually ask both.  And then I usually ask both for mankind and yourself.  It can be either way.
<br><br>
Alex:  Okay.
<br><br>
Holly:  So, what about your personal?
<br><br>
Alex:  I was thinking about my personal future.
<br><br>
Leo:  Well, it's not like goals or dreams or anything.  What it usually comes down to is it's more of a positive, negative type thing.
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah.
<br><br>
Alex:  And I see myself developing in my career with music, getting to the point where I can make money off it and not do a side job.  And then being with this one right here (smiles at Holly).
<br><br>
Leo  This is where it becomes the two of you in an interesting kind of... .
<br><br>
Alex + Holly:  (Laughs)  
<br><br>
Holly:  I see myself in some sort of design capacity in the sense of connecting people to spaces and… bring all these ideas I have into fruition, whatever that means.  And I see… I might see this guy  (Laughs) .
<br><br>
Alex:  Let's see how these next questions go. (Laughs)


</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/hollyandalex/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Alex:  Do you mean like possession?
<br><br>
Leo:  Most people don't answer material objects, but usually… it could be your PlayStation if that's what's important to you, your KRK monitors, if that's what's important to you.  (Laughs)  But, okay, you know what I mean.
<br><br>
Alex:  Happiness.  I mean, it's really straight forward.  Yeah.
<br><br>
Holly:  Family… of course. (Thinking)
<br><br>
Leo:  All right, do you want to elaborate on happiness or family?
<br><br>
Alex:  I mean, happiness is pretty generalized, there are a lot of things that can make you happy.  But I think at the end of the day… money, career…  I mean really it just comes down to happiness.
<br><br>
Holly:  I think your family's the most important thing in your life, and it's what gives you a sense of purpose.  Yeah, I love my family.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Holly:  (Laughs)  You first.
<br><br>
Leo:  “Well first, blonde hair” (Laughs) 
<br><br>
Alex:  Well no, for looks I actually prefer dark hair, and nice booties.
<br><br>
Holly:  Check, check. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Leo:  Maybe because I don't think anyone's ever gone for the physical traits first, because this has never happened before.
<br><br>
Holly:  You brought it up  (Laughs).  
<br><br>
Alex:  Look for in a partner, somebody who makes me laugh.
<br><br>
Leo:  This is going to be so cool seeing it on video.
<br><br>
Holly:  (Laughs)  
<br><br>
Alex:  Somebody who is just down to do anything and have fun.  Somebody who gives me space when I need it.  Let's me kind of have my freedom, I guess… someone who's not too clingy.  Someone who likes my music, and likes what I’m doing with that.  They don't have to like everything I'm doing, but respects it.  I have to take a lot of time away to be a hermit.  So somebody who can definitely handle that and have their own life, somebody who's passionate about their career. I'll leave it at that.
<br><br>
Holly:  I think, somebody who makes me want to be a better person in the way I can't be, or I don't think in that way.  Somebody who challenges me and makes me want to be a better person.  
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/hollyandalex/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 Alex:  Yes, absolutely.
<br><br>
Holly:  I think, yes.  I think… yes.
<br><br>
Leo: Woah, so we have a “Yes, absolutely” on one side and a “I think…yes” on the other (Everyone laughs). OK, do you want children in the future?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, I see children before marriage.
<br><br>
Leo:  Okay, that's great because the next thing is, so do you have an image of how you want your children to grow up?  Is there something you really want to do with them when they're a little bit older or when they're adults, or whatever?
<br><br>
Alex: Yeah.  I mean, I'm just so excited about playing sports, basketball.  Even teaching them to make music, I don't know.
<br><br>
Leo:  That would be so much fun.
<br><br>
Alex:  That would be so much fun.  Or, teaching them an instrument, giving them an instrument to play.  Something that's a hobby that they can carry with them throughout their adulthood.
<br><br>
Holly:  What was the question?
<br><br>
Leo:  Do you have an image of how you want them to grow up, or is there something you want to do with them?
<br><br>
Holly:  Um…(Thinking)…  Yeah, I see children, I see having multiple children.  So, siblings.  I want to teach them how to love, how to love each other and how to love themselves.  And I just want to spend time with them, I want them to know their mommy.

</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Alex:  (Thinking)  I don't know, I feel stumped on that one.  
<br><br>
Holly:  Well, you wanna see me, right?
<br><br>
Alex:  Well, I do see you.  (Everyone laughs)  I'm also think more kind of like ethereal dream right now for some reason, and that's kind of what popped into my head.
<br><br>
Holly:  I want to see a life that I built for myself, and inner space, and just up in the air, too.  I want to see a space that makes me comfortable, that's a home.  Yes.
<br><br>
Leo: Very cool, coming from an interior designer!  And that's the same thing before you go to sleep and when you wake up?  I mean when you wake up?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah.
<br><br>
Alex:  I think I'd like more sounds, like going to sleep. I think I'd like to hear ocean waves.  And then waking up, birds chirping or singing, like a beautiful woman's voice singing.
<br><br>
Leo: Does Holly ever sing before you wake up?
<br><br>
Alex:  Holly?  She has before and I always remember it.  It sounded really angelic.
<br><br>
Leo:  Wow! 
<br><br>
Alex:  And it was super dream-like.  I really like to wake up to that, so that's it, probably.
<br><br>
Holly:  It was one time.
<br><br>
Alex:  It was one time, but it always stuck with me.
<br><br>
Leo:  If that is what he's saying is ideal, you know what will happen next time when she wants you to do whatever. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah, you got to get those bar stools.

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/hollyandalex/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Alex:  Happiest moment? (Thinking)… I think the happiest moment that first popped into my head was my first road trip. Like my first really long road trip.  It was the first time when you're 18, you're sort of like, free.
<br><br>
Leo:  Where did you start, and where were you going to?
<br><br>
Alex:  That was when I went to Victoria.  That was with my buddy, Josh, but that was the first time.  We just graduated, let’s go do something fun when we're 18.  And that was just so much fun, just the freedom of it, you're like, “let's go”.  So that was one of the happiest, at least during that time of my life.
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, a road trip came to mind for me, too.  I think one of the road trips we took to San Fransisco.  The first time… when we went to see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldintwelve.com/en/matrix/sanfrancisco_x_twelve_questions#geoff">Geoff</a>, actually, that was a good trip, that was a fun trip.  And just traveling and… understanding what a life you can build for yourself and how free you really are.
<br><br>
Leo:  Cool.  Do you have a frightening moment?
<br><br>
Holly:  Oh, that one, too.  Moving to New York was a little scary.  It was scarier when Alex moved to New York.  (Laughs)  
<br><br>
Alex:  Oh, yeah, why was that?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, I don't know, it was a wild card.
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah, it was our first time living together, like officially. And yeah, we had spent so much time with each other.
<br><br>
Leo:  Going from semi to truly 24/7?
<br><br>
Alex:  Yeah.  I wasn't really… I was more excited.  I wasn't really afraid of that.  I'm trying to think of fear.  I think any kind of performing I always get really nervous.  My heart gets really fast and I get really shaky, but then once I get in the rhythm, I lose all that.  Yeah… that's probably for me consistently scary.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Alex:  Childhood dream?  I had a teenage dream, does that count?
<br><br>
Leo: Of course! 
<br><br>
Alex:  I wanted to be a pro snowboarder.  I really wanted to… that was before I discovered music, really before I started producing.  What I'd tell myself is… or, what I would have done differently, I guess, is learned an instrument earlier in my life.
<br><br>
Leo:  Would you tell him that, though?
<br><br>
Alex:  Would I tell him that?
<br><br>
Leo:  Because you're trying to become a snowboarder. 
<br><br>
Alex:  Well, I would have said, “Give up snowboarding, man, pick up the guitar now and don't ever let up”. (Everyone laughs)  Yeah.
<br><br>
Holly:  I wanted to be an artist and a police woman at the same time.
<br><br>
Leo:  Artistic police woman?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah, that's what comes to mind first, I remember thinking that.  The police woman didn't turn out, but that's okay.   (Laughs)  What would I tell myself?  (Thinking)…  Just not to be afraid of who you are, it doesn't change when you get older, you're still that person.  And the sooner you embrace that, the happier you'll be.
<br><br>
Leo: (Looking at Alex) I think you like her answer just as much as I do! And finally, what's your dream now?
<br><br>
Alex:  Music. Make a career out of it.  Whether that's producing music for others, performing or making music for a film or something, I just want to be involved in it.  And I'm going to be.
<br><br>
Holly:  Um…(Thinking)… well, my dream is to build the life I want.
<br><br>
Leo:  That's not just professionally, is what you're implying, right?
<br><br>
Holly:  Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo:  All right, great, thank you very much!!
