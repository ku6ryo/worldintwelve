    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：25　Years in New York： 1 1/2<br>
     <br>  
    Katarina was introduced to me through Nana. What I found truly interesting about Katarina was her background--being half Hungarian half Korean, schooling in Utah, college in LA, studying abroad in various European cities, now in NY--and through those experiences, her views towards life and education (being a teacher). Katarina showed me around Williamsburg where she used to live, and the location, Bakery, was an amazing cafe I really recommend. Katarina's answers were very elequent, concise, and to the point--it seemed she chose every word knowing it would be the perfect one to portray the picture in her mind. I recommend her close country (Q.2), her "thing"--one of the mose unique answers I've gotten (Q.7), her moments (Q.11), and her dream (Q.12). So see you again Katarina, whether it be in Europe or US or Asia! We will continue to be the children of the world!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: So this is Bakery. It's a little bakery in Williamsburg and I picked it because when I first moved here, for a month between my first year away from school I lived a couple blocks away. And I’d come here often and I think that this is one of my first spots in Williamsburg that I frequented. I also think that Williamsburg very much represents the face of young New York right now, so I think that it would be an interesting place. It's in the prime area but it's still a little bit removed from the main tourist area, so I thought it'd be good.  </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/katarina/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   So I started answering this question a little early (Laughs). I would go to South America because I haven't been, and I also would like to learn Spanish. I learned a little bit in middle school and high school but it's been a while since I actually focused on learning a language, so I think that I would go to South America and sort of travel around through Argentina, Chile, and then pause from learning Spanish and hop over to Brazil. 
<br><br>
>>>Where you could learn some Portuguese.
<br><br>
 Yeah, so that's what I would do. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
   That’s… a really difficult question… but I think strangely--actually, not very strangely--I think the Netherlands, and it's because I lived there for six months in college. I think that it was… very cultural and very diverse and sort of quaint and lovely, and I think I just connected with the city and enjoyed its people and what it had to offer. I feel, still, I feel very closely connected to it even though I'm not from the Netherlands in any way.
<br><br>
>>>It's interesting. So more than Hungary and more than South Korea, which you're half and half of. 
<br><br>
Yeah. I think even though I've been to Korea many times and I lived in Hungary for six months, I felt… as though I was very much separate from these countries that I actually should feel connected to, which was interesting in a way… But I think I see myself as more of a product of the world as opposed to one specific place, and I think that Amsterdam is more progressive than both of the countries that my parents came from, so I feel actually more connected to just being in a very diverse city as opposed to being in a more homogeneous culture like South Korea. 
<br><br>
>>>That's very interesting. So basically when you add Hungary plus South Korea and divide it by two and growing up in the United States does not equal either one. It's more something like Amsterdam, which is very, very cool. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/katarina/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
  I'll start with the place because it's the first thing I can think of (Laughs). I'd say… Central Park. And I don't actually think that it has a great representation of just Manhattan in general, but I do think that the foundation of building a park where people in the city can gather and where there's no barrier to entry and that actually covers so much of the city is huge in and of itself. I also think that when I think of New York, I think of people wanting to visit. I see it as a very transient city, constantly moving, and I think that Central Park draws a lot of people. So although it might not be locals all of the time, I think that a lot of Manhattan is people visiting Manhattan, and I think Central Park would sort of represent that. But it's interesting because I haven't actually lived in Manhattan. I've only lived in Brooklyn, so I think the question would be different if it was framed like, what is the one place in Brooklyn that represents New York.
<br><br>
 >>>Do you have a thing? 
<br><br>
A thing? I would say--this is going to sound so cliche—(Thnking) …actually, no, at first I was going to say coffee in a way, because this city is constantly moving and people need it to survive here, at least from my experience. But I actually think the subway. Its…It is the vehicle that connects the web of people and places in New York, and I think that it's incredibly important and makes New York what it is. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    (Thinking)…I’m not sure if I would do it, because I… Would I do it? (Thinking)… I think that it depends on how… one wants to perceive the U.S. I see it in a very different way that someone else might see it, and so I don't know if my representation of the U.S. would actually be an accurate representation, an accurate symbol for everyone, although I don't even know-- 
<br><br>
>>>Is this the teacher in you speaking? 
<br><br>
(Laughs) In what way? 
<br><br>
>>>Because you're trying a very, very politically correct way of thinking. It's your decision!! 
<br><br>
Definitely…so, again, I am speaking very politically…(Laughs). Yeah, I don't see the-- I also don't know if this'll be--OK. I wouldn't redesign it. I don't think it's necessary. That's the easy answer.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
 Foam, sand. I think the realization that we're so small in this massive world. Just the continuation of things when everything else might be still, the water is always moving. I don't know if that's too long. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
 I immediately thought of white, like the… This lightness. Also, this consistency… Anything can change, but you know that the sun will rise the next day. Well, unless you live in Seattle (Laughs)
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 Black.
<br><br>
>>>As opposed to the sun, which was white. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Also, a part of life, and unknown. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 Yeah. I could talk about myself, but I think mankind is more interesting. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. I'll be hearing more about yourself later today :) 
<br><br>
I mean, I think it's-- Actually, they're kind of interconnected. For myself, I feel very positively about the future and am always charged thinking about it, but I think what is interesting is this dichotomy of me being excited about my future, but when I think about the future of mankind I see it as more of a dystopian future, which could be influenced by readings that I've done in the past, or also just what I see…the way that I see some things evolving. (Thinking)…I think this winter in New York sort of made it real for me. Realizing that temperatures are changing around the world. That's kind of frightening when you think about it, but when you experience it and realize that you just have to adapt, I think that sort of made it a little bit more real. Rambling, haha.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/katarina/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
(Thinking)… I think “movement”. I know that's abstract, but for me I think it sort of has affected my life in different ways. Just like a kinesthetic movement. I was a dancer growing up. Movement, geographic movement. I've lived in a lot of different cities. Also, moving out of your comfort zone to take certain risks in life is important. Just this flow, this change, this movement.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  I mean, I think my biggest thing is intelligence, and not in a necessarily… traditional educational way. I think just the desire to know and learn and reflect and change oneself for the better. And I think if that is the crux of that person, then I think that positive change for that person can happen and, I don't know… Yeah. That's the main piece of it, and then there are a million other things, but... (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Can you give us one of the million things? 
<br><br>
 Just, passion. 
<br><br>
>>>Can you give me another millionth thing? We don't have to elaborate on another one. I'm just interested. 
<br><br>
 I think humor is really important to me… The appreciation of good food. Just simple things. Conversation. Desire to grow personally. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/katarina/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
  Marriage: I don't know. 
<br><br>
 >>>I don't know is a good answer. 
<br><br>
It's a solid I don't know (laughs)
<br><br>
 >>>Nice. However, regarding the I don't know, do you want children? 
<br><br>
 …I’d say right now I like to say no immediately, but I think one day the answer will be yes, so yes. (Everyone Laughs) I think in any other conversation I'd be like, "No, of course not!" And I think it's because I'm just thinking about right now. Like, “no, I would not want to have a child right now”. 
<br><br>
 >>>I think everybody can relate with that. Actually I don't know if everybody can, but a lot of people can. 
<br><br>
Right. But I think eventually, I think so. 
<br><br>
Okay. So regarding that, once you do, you don't know when, but most likely some time, possibly, most likely in the future, is there anything you want to do with them or is there any visual way you see them in the way you want them to grow up? 
<br><br>
>>>Right. Sort of my area of expertise. I think just fostering a true sense of wonder and curiosity for the world around them, whether that's taking them to different places to learn about different cultures, try different foods. Giving them that exposure to then explore their world and find what is interesting to them. And I think doing that in a very intentional way to help them gain that sort of independent desire of learning. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
  I like that question. I think I skimmed over that question unintentionally when I was reading them. I mean, I think waking up and just seeing the sun and a bright blue sky. I think that could be, it could be anywhere, but I think just a nice day. I think also starting the day fairly early. I'm not an early morning person, but if I wake up naturally and gotten enough sleep, which doesn't often happen (Laughs), but I think if I did it would be great. So maybe I would see the sun, I would see a beautiful sky, and I would see a delicious breakfast. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Great. Prepared by whom? 
<br><br>
 Not me. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
 >>>Haha somebody then. OK, And what would be the thing you'd see before you go to sleep? 
<br><br>
That… I don't know. For some reason now I'm thinking about an actual location. Before I go to sleep it'd be nice to be somewhere that I really love, whether it's in the mountains and I see a starry sky, or I'm at the ocean and I hear the waves before I fall asleep. Yeah…for some reason I think of a location more so when I'm falling asleep than when I'm waking up.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Okay, the happiest… I'm trying to think of THE happiest, and I don't know if there's one moment that I was like, "This is the best moment of my life!" but I think one that sort of gave me the most of an adrenaline rush, which could arguably be the happiest, was one of the most exciting moments of my life was when I was I think thirteen or fourteen. Fourteen. I… went to an audition because my dance teacher told me to go and I was like, “I don't really care”. I didn't care at the time. But I ended up dancing in the opening ceremonies for the 2002 Olympics. 
<br><br>
 >>>Oh, really? The Olympics? 
<br><br>
Yeah. (Laughs) It was really incredible for me. So we practiced for months before, and I think just being there that night wearing my pioneer costume, dancing, choreography by someone I really respected, and that whole process but culminating at the actual night was pretty incredible. 
<br><br>
 >>>Wow. So you've been in an Olympic ceremony before? 
<br><br>
 Yes. 
<br><br>
 >>>Not just been to one. You were in one. Wow. 
<br><br>
Yes. Okay. And then the most terrifying. (Thinking)… So I haven't really been terrified many times in my life, so that word is a little too intense. But I remember a very frightening moment, and it's so silly when I think about it but at the time I remember the feeling. But just being… I was lost at a grocery store as a young person (Laughs). Yes, as a young munchkin. It was so terrifying, because now I feel like I can handle anything, I feel that way, but at the time I felt so lost. 
<br><br>
>>>How old were you?
<br><br>
I don't remember my age at all. I'm assuming… four? But I remember wandering up and asking the cashier to page my family. So scary (Laughs)… just thinking about it makes me nervous. So that's a moment.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Interesting. My childhood dream was definitely to be like some sort of actor… which is funny because now I feel like I do that every day in a weird way, but I think the desire of-- 
<br><br>
 >>>Sorry to interrupt but she’s speaking on behalf of all other teachers here, teachers are “acting” a lot every day!
<br><br>
 >>>Right, so I think the art of theater I think is so valuable, but I think in college--that was when I was very young. I think in high school I started seeing the world in a different way, after I went to Nicaragua. It sounds like an Onion story (Leo bursts into laughter), like, “worked on an orphanage and then just wanted to help people”. But actually, I think my priorities shifted when I saw how other people lived, and then it wasn't so much about me as it was about what I could do. Although… I don't like saying it in that way because I also respect the work that actors do. But yeah, that's when it sort of shifted. So when I was fourteen, that's when I went. And then-- Wait, what was the question? Childhood dream and? 
<br><br>
 >>>And what would you tell the childhood you now? 
<br><br>
 I would just say explore what you're interested in doing and keep doing it. Very simple. 
 <br><br>
 >>>Very simple. Is that what you tell the kids you teach? 
<br><br>
 On one on one conversations, yes. I think also what I do now is very-- the goal is very clear. It's very academically focused, so to get to that big picture… it happens, but it's not every day. That's not my mantra to my kids. I think their situation's also very different from what mine is. 
<br><br>
>>>Finally, your dream now. 
<br><br>
 Ah…my dream now is way more abstract, because it's not tangible. I don't see my successes being this concrete point that I want to reach, and I think it also goes to the advice that I would have given myself. It's the same advice that I follow. I don't know if that's right for everyone. It's right for me, so I'm just continuing to do what I am interested in and passionate about… and just trying to see how I can create the most change, help people in the way I'm the most capable of. And I just want to snowboard and eat delicious food. 
<br><br>
>>>I don't think anyone can argue with that!!
