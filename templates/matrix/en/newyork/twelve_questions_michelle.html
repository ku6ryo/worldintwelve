    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in New York： Almost 10<br>
     <br>  
    Michelle was introduced to me through Sayaka, and she showed me around an area of New York that one native New Yorker I talked to didn't know existed lol. The complex is called Tudor City in Midtown East, adjacent to the United Nations, and it has some of the most architecturally interesting apartments in Manhattan. It was so fun talking with Michelle before and after the 12 Questions, and she gave me insight and knowledge on so many topics ranging from 20-somethings immigrating to urban areas to the rise of land prices in North Dakota. We also went to a bodega after drinks, and gained insight on another important factor useful while living in New York--the sandwiches you get at these places are the best bang for your buck in town! Haha. Regarding the questions Michelle gave a lot of unique answers, but my recommendations are her month (Q.1), her images (Q.5), her children (Q.9), and her dream (Q.12). Thanks again Michelle it was great to meet up, and do come to Japan when Sayaka and I are there!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: So, we’re at a bar called Tuttles (Leo laughs), I chose it because it’s down the street from my house and I live in Midtown East, and if you’re not familiar it’s not very good for bars but this particular bar is kind of great on weekdays because there’s nobody here.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, a perfect amount of people here (Laughs).
<br><br>
Yeah, there’s a perfect amount of people here, so that’s why I chose it.  Slim pickin’s in midtown east,  close to my apartment. </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/michelle/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   OK, I’ve actually thought about this a lot, like every day of my life, because I’ve thought about taking a month off between jobs at some point.  And… I already also know how much it would cost, if that seems too organized, but, um, I would fly to Moscow and take the Trans-Siberian railroad through Mongolia to Beijing.  And it takes about six days… and the trip itself, I think is about 900 USD.  I’ve already priced all of this, I’m so sorry.  Yeah, so I would do that and hop off in China a bunch.  I don’t know how much I want to hang out in Mongolia, I’m not really sure what’s there, probably a lot of desert and stuff…??  But, yeah, I’d probably hop off a bunch in China and then I’d take trains through China. …I actually read this book by one of my favorite travel writers a little while ago, his name is Paul Theroux, he wrote this book called “Riding the Iron Rooster”.  It’s about riding trains through China and he wrote it at a couple of different times during different points in China’s development, throughout the last 50, 60 years… and it was pretty inspiring and I think he’s probably one of the first people who gave me the travel itch as well.  So, I’d want to do that.  Again, my interest in Asia, so that has a lot to do with it.
<br><br>
>>>I didn’t even know the Trans-Siberian railroad went to Beijing! 
<br><br>
Yeah, so there’s a couple of different routes you can take.  The train cars are a lot better than they used to be… I think I’d probably need a little more money to do it, but that’s probably what I’d do with my money.
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
   OK. So, the country I feel closest to is probably Singapore, just because my work has brought me there for the past almost three years in a pretty powerful way.  I’ve worked, and work with people from Singapore everyday cross border. I’ve also been there a number of times, I’ve established a huge network there, and you know that’s part of being connected to a city is just having people there that you know and love and want to hang out with.  So, it’s probably Singapore.
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/michelle/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 What do you mean “thing”?
<br><br>
>>> It could be the same answer.  Thing can be anything. It could be the same thing if you want to. It could be tangible, it could be non-tangible.
<br><br>
So… I think, the most obvious thing that comes to my mind like what we’ve been talking a little bit about, is diversity but not only culturally, but professionally and industry wise just because I feel like with some cities, it’s like… everybody kind of works in similar industries, but in New York I have friends that are waitresses but also making it as a writer.  I have friends in tech and finance and entrepreneur friends—you know, friends who are entrepreneurs.  So, it’s nice and we all hang out together and I feel like that’s a pretty special thing for New York.  You know you find a lot of large cities, but I think especially here, it’s pretty prevalent. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   So, I would 100% not redesign the American flag, because it’s been… OK, so for the first reason is I have a personal patriotic connection to the American flag because I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia and as you may know, Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag and I’ve been to the Betsy Ross house many times! So I don’t know, I’ve kind of seen the history of where that’s started and also if you look at the design of the American flag—
<br><br>
>>>Which has been redesigned a few times (Laughs)
<br><br>
It’s been redesigned a number of times, so yeah, I don’t think I would… because of Betsy Ross.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
So, I think of my beach house in Sea Isle… so it wasn’t mine, but every summer when I was a kid, my family would rent a beach house in Sea Isle City in New Jersey, which is one of the beach towns in South Jersey and it was a wonderful experience as a kid.  It was kind of the big vacation our family took, so, yeah, probably our beach house in Sea Isle City.
<br><br>
—The Sun <br>
So, one of my favorite songs is called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIKsHh3BFPI">“Sunny Afternoon”</a> by The Kinks, and that’s the first thing that popped in my head.  It’s actually I guess not a thing, it’s a song, it’s called “Sunny Afternoon” by the Kinks and it’s great, I don’t know if you’ve heard it, you should listen to it.
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 So for me…so for me personally, whenever I think of the word death, I actually think of the word “eternity” because I had a close death in my immediate family and it’s kind of affected my family for… since it happened when I was a kid, so it’s going to affect me for the rest of my life, so actually I think of the word eternity when I think of the word death.
 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Ok…so for myself, I’m a pretty optimistic person by nature, so…(thinking)… I would say that, yeah for myself, for my future, I’m pretty confident that I’ve made it this far so… I guess I have high hopes for the future, whatever that may bring. I know there’s a lot of external factors that can affect my optimism or not and they have in the past, but I think that’s brought me through a lot, just having a positive outlook. Hmmm…for, what’d you say, for mankind?
<br><br>
>>> United States, whatever, just a little bigger scale.
<br><br>
So, on a global scale, I guess what’s the scariest thing actually to me is probably climate change, because that’s what I’ve been reading up on lately, but… you slowly start to see the effects of it in the United States and around the world whether it’s being the weather or effecting large populations more quickly than others. And I think that’s going to have a big impact on my generation and the generations after me as well and it’s something that we’re going to have to deal with and I don’t think people are probably taking as seriously as they should.  Maybe including myself, I’m probably guilty of that, but hopefully in the future there’s more tangible things that come into light that just as a generation and a population— especially in a high consuming country like the United States can do.  I hope that makes sense.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/michelle/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Thing? Probably like anybody, family… yeah family and loved ones. (Thinks)…  I come from a particularly supportive family, I still talk to my parents everyday.
<br><br>
>>>Every day?
<br><br> 
Yeah, every day.
<br><br>
>>>Just like texting? Actually on the telephone?
<br><br>
On the telephone, for sure. Yeah, so I think that’s really important, family, whether that’s your parents, your brother, your sister, your friends, your significant other, whoever that may be, yeah, I think that’s the most important thing.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 So, what do I look for in a partner?  Somebody who’s… caring and funny and super honest, reliable… passionate… independent to an extent, just because I see myself as an independent person as well, so reliable but also remaining as independent people. Loving… all the general things.
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/michelle/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
  Marriage: Yes, 100%<br>
Children: Yes, a child or children.<br><br>


So, yes, so there’s a couple of things.  Number one, I would like to send them to summer camp.  I went to summer camp from age five and then I became a camp counselor until I was age 20 and I think it actually shaped me a lot of who I am today, the friends I’ve made, the activities I did there, the camp counselors who influenced me.
<br><br>
>>>Are you still friends with friends from summer camp?
<br><br>
Yes, I’m still friends with friends from summer camp. You know, It’s one of those big camps out in the middle of woods in Southern New Jersey in the pine barrens.  Lakes and cabins, everything was outdoors, we played capture the flag, we had Harry Potter week, which was awesome.  …I think I was on Team Slytherin for a couple of years, which was disappointing, (Leo laughs) but yeah! We did archery and swam, it was amazing.  Sending my kid to summer camp, number one.  Number two, I would like them to… you know, just try everything.  I think when I was a kid, my parents immersed me in a lot and it really helps expand your visibility on the world, whether it’s sports or music or visual arts, whatever it may be, science, math, I don’t know, whatever they’re into, but just let them go explore.
<br><br>
>>>So those two.
<br><br> 
Two… three, probably travel, you know I didn’t travel abroad at all when I was a kid.
<br><br>
>>>You said your dad had never been out of the country.
<br><br>
No! But which actually ended up to be OK, they were very well read, they taught me a lot about a lot of different things and I think it was OK that I never had that other exposure… but we were also next to a big city, so it was OK.  I think, just because I like traveling abroad, exposing after that and like other cultures pretty quickly would be definitely a requirement.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
  OK, that’s easy, two things and it’s going to be the same answer.  My loved one, of course and also a long haired dachshund, they’re my favorite dogs. My parents have one right now named Tucker, I grew up with one named Alexander and long haired dachshunds are my favorite dogs in the entire world, so I want to wake up to my loved one and a long haired dachshund, to be determined, whichever dog that may be, licking my face, licking my face.
<br><br>
>>>Before you go to sleep, you still want to get licked in your face before you go to sleep?
<br><br>
 Yes, absolutely.
<br><br>
 >>>Haha! Alright, that’s great.
<br><br>
They’re my favorite dog.

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/newyork/twelve_questions/michelle/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Let’s say… I don’t know if this is the absolute happiest moment.
<br><br>
>>>It doesn’t have to be an absolute, a lot of people have a lot of.
<br><br>
We have a lot of happy moments, I mean I wish that upon everybody, but I was actually real excited to get into college. It was a really pivotal moment for me. You know in high school, I got good grades, but I was also one of those students who had to try really really hard. I couldn’t coast through a class or take an exam without studying… I had to study really hard and then maybe I did well, but it paid off because I got into college and I was… I just remember seeing the couple acceptance letters I got, because I only applied to a few schools. And for one of the schools I got into, I remember getting in the car with my dad and driving around my neighborhood to find my mom who was out walking and telling her! And it was just a really really cool moment because I knew I was moving to New York… I always loved New York, I only applied to New York City schools and I knew it was happening and it was going to happen for me.  It was real exciting.  College was a very big deal for me.  I know for a lot of people it was like “Oh, I got into college, I’m going, I guess I’ll figure it out”.  I already had it part way figured out and this just kind of helped me push myself in the direction I wanted to go in. So, yeah.
<br><br>
>>> Do you have a terrifying moment?
<br><br>
Yeah…so a close family member of mine passed away… when I was very young, when I was pretty young, when I was 12.  It was one of those moments where it was really intense, I was aware it was going on, and…it was in my immediate family. I was aware it was going on, but I also didn’t know what was going on, I didn’t understand why it was happening because I’m also young enough where I wasn’t really exposed to that.  So… and it still affects me to this day, it’s just one of those really intense moments… its had a very powerful, long, impact in my life. I mean I’m very lucky that my parents and I are still so close and we’ve also been super close… the reason I’m so connected to summer camp is because my summer camp when I was a kid was super supportive… so that was an easy one.  That was easily the most terrifying moment.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
So, if we’re going way back, I’m going to dip back real far.  When I was in elementary school, I 100% knew I wanted to be an ice cream truck driver. (Leo laughs) I get to drive a truck, play music and serve ice cream, like those chocolate tacos , all at the same time, best deal ever.  That faded quickly.  I was eight, I didn’t have a driver’s license, it just like wasn’t going to happen for me.  Um…but, then when I was in high school, I thought I wanted to go work in the fashion industry. On the business side of the industry… I didn’t really know what that meant yet, but I knew that the college I picked may help me get there.  And it was interesting because it helped me kind of evolve my idea of what it meant to work in the industry, and also what other industries were connected to the fashion industry that I could also work in… that are pivotal in making the whole industry run.  And what was the last part of that, what do I want to do?
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell your child to do now?
<br><br>
So… I would probably tell, it’s not one of those things where I have any regrets, because I have zero, but… I would definitely tell my high school self to go into computer engineering, no I’m just kidding. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Be more rational!! 
<br><br>
>>> Be more rational!! Haha!  Maybe to broaden my idea of what it meant to choose a major and choose a school and what it meant to work.  In high school, nobody really tells you that and you’re just like, “Oh, I like this industry, I’m going to go to school for it”, but that doesn’t mean that it’s going to be lucrative, or that you’re going to be good at it or that you’re going to even like it, but you have this ideal of what that means.  …Yeah, so maybe I would tell my high school self to just search a little deeper about what I wanted to do instead of just scratching the surface a little bit.  At the time I didn’t think I was scratching the surface, but now looking back I just see it as scratching the surface.
<br><br>
>>> And finally, what’s your dream now?
<br><br>
So…I feel like I’m partly living it, just because… I mean I feel very lucky  to like the job I’m in because from what I understand a lot of people may not love their jobs and I’m actually really excited to build on what I’m doing now, which is working cross-border and internationally with businesses. And it sounds super businessy and whatever, but I’m really interested in it and just bridging cultures and business boundaries, is an amazing to  experience firsthand, so I’m doing that now which is awesome and I’m excited to build on that. Yeah! And of course, aside from career, have a family, et cetera, all that stuff.
