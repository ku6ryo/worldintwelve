    <p><span class="name">Dora Bami</span></p>
    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：30　Years in Paris: 3<br>
     <br>  
Dora was introduced to me through Shu. Dora is a Greek fashion designer with experience in various brands in Paris. I had a nice meal and cafe with Dora, and we touched on a various interesting subjects. I learned about the educational system and the mentality of the baby-boom generation in Greece, and also about lesser known island getaways that will be great potential vacation spots in the future. However what stood out the most was Dora’s personal story. I had met many people throughout my year who were aspiring and persevering to achieve a dream or goal, and Dora’s case was a prime example. The decision’s she made, to throw one’s self out into the unknown, to grab life by the horns, is truly inspiring. Oh, and she also has an amazing smile :) For her questions, I’d recommend her month (Q.1),  future (Q.6), moments (Q.11), and dreams (Q.12). So Dora, I know we’ll meet again, and Japan would be a cool place to do that!! Cheers!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: Here? I don’t know if it’s the ideal place to make interviews. (Leo laughs)  I was trying to think of a place that has nice desserts. (Leo laughs) And the area here is full of Japanese restaurants, so I couldn’t think of better option. But it’s a really nice example of the Parisian life.  It’s good to see all the different parts of Paris.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
I think my first place would be Africa. Travel all around. Talk with the native people. Learn their traditions . Dress up like them. Have the same make up they have. Explore the nature.  Learn techniques in different kind of arts they have. I would do that I think. 
<br><br>
>>>Why Africa?
<br><br>
I don’t know. I feel like I’m connected in one way. It’s not that I researched a lot about it but I think I like the culture . Even here in Paris, there are many African people.
<br><br>
>>>That’s true. They’re wearing their native clothes.
<br><br>
They’re wearing their clothes. They’re happy to wear them. And in Paris, also I worked a lot with African French people. And you see the difference. They are so happy all the time. (Leo laughs) They smile all the time. They laugh out loud and they talk loudly and they dance so much. I love dancing. And there’s a place here in Paris, I’d be happy to show you. It’s called Comptoir General and it’s a bar. And it’s like a trip to Africa. They have live African music, a flea market, exotic drinks and African food. A small exhibition. Sometimes they are projecting films, and it’s one of my favorite places in Paris. I danced a lot there with African French people. (Laughs)  I like their energy.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
I think Italy. I traveled a lot in Italy. I feel very close to them. I really understand them. The way they are very expressive as us, Greek people. They enjoy life as us. They are louder than us. (Both laugh) And I don’t know. I just find them very funny, and fun to be around them. And I love the food. I love the country, it is beautiful. I traveled a lot in the north and the center of the country and it’s just amazing. Every time I go, I know that I will see a beautiful place. I will talk with beautiful people. Happy people. And I will eat amazing food. I don’t compare Italian food with anything. It’s really good. So yeah, I think Italy.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
(Thinking)... Thing that represents the city? I think a croissant. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Oh, very good. (laughs)
<br><br>
I wake up in the morning, I want to have one. It’s really good. And the place? I don’t know. The river, I think. 
<br><br>
>>>The Seine.
<br><br>
The Seine. Yeah. I love this place.
<br><br>
>>>Is there a particular part of the Seine that you like? (Laughs) It is a pretty long river.
<br><br>
It is really long, yeah. (laughs) In the center, yes. To have this walk, it’s very relaxing for me.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
About the Greek one? I don’t think so but I think it’s perfect like this.
<br><br>
>>>The Greek flag?
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s the colors of the country, the sea and the sky.  And yeah, it’s a little bit complicated with the lines. As a child, I was trying to draw it and I was always confused with the lines. (Both Laugh)  I think I wouldn’t change it but the French one? I don’t know. I never thought about it. About changing the flags.  I don’t think so.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
(Thinking)… An image of the ocean? Yeah. (Thinking)… I don’t know. I’m thinking about my vacation this summer. I discovered in the island that I was, the Koufonissia. It was a place that it wasn’t easy to access. You had to walk through the rocks and it was a little bit scary and dangerous . And there was a beach, a secret beach behind the rocks.  That it was called, the name was “Milk” because the water was white and it wasn’t transparent. You couldn’t see inside. And the water was coming from a cave that was underwater, and it was connecting with the sea. So everyone was going there to see the Milk, but with my boyfriend, we continued farher. And it was the biggest natural balcony that I saw. It was like a theater. 
<br><br>
>>>So actually like, steps.
<br><br>
It was like steps. Like big steps of a stage for the people to go and sit, and have the amazing view of the sea. And it was just you, the rocks, and the sea. And it was just beautiful. I could stay there for hours. And we took very beautiful pictures. (laughs)
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
The sun? (Thinking)… I can only think my vacations now! (laughs) I’m still thinking about that. Yeah, walking around to the rocks with the sunset. I don’t know. It’s just Greece. Ocean, sun. It’s Greece. It’s my country. The islands. This is the image. 
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Death. Death. An image about death. I don’t know. As i am growing older i prefer to see it in a more positive way. I prefer to see it like an option of a new beginning. I don’t know what comes after that. So maybe rebirth.
<br><br>
>>>Huh. Very interesting. Skipping all the stuff that was already rebirth. (laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. (laughs) It’s like orgasms. They say that an orgasm is like a small death. It’s an expression.
<br><br>
>>>I don’t know what that means. 
<br><br>
It could be the same.
<br><br>
>>>Now we’re really getting deep. (Both laugh)



 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>

The future is full of hope and possibilities! And the best response to that is a French documentary that I watched lately ... It's called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.demain-lefilm.com/en">"Demain : Tomorrow..."</a> And it's very inspiring full of solutions for us and our planet! Everyone should watch it!



</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/dora/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Love. I think, that love in general. Love me, love people, my boyfriend. Love… nature. Yeah, I think it’s the most interesting thing for me. Otherwise, it isn’t worth it.



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
In a partner? Everything! (laughs) I don’t know. Of course, love. Inspiration. Challenge. New ideas. Something that I never thought exists. A new way of thinking. A partner in life. Passion? A lot of passion. And but mostly, inspiration, I think. I need someone that inspires me, that makes me think that yeah, I should do that. I should be like that. I should try more. I should learn more. I should travel more. 




  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/dora/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
[Marriage] I could but it’s not my goal.<br>
[Children] At least one. One day. I would like to have at least one, but I don’t want to not have one at all.
<br><br>
[Second part]
<br><br>
I think so, yeah. Of course, I would love them to death. And I would like to travel a lot with them. I would like them to be very close to nature, to explore a lot. I would like them to meditate like, since they are babies. To know what the meaning of meditation, and how to be connected with yourself, and the source inside you. Not just living this world as everyone else. Be connected with you and nature. To understand what that means. Yeah, I really want to start from that, and then everything else.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Right now, because it’s very recent and I’m very in love with my boyfriend, I would like it to be my boyfriend. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>What do you mean by right now? So is it usually different?
<br><br>
No, I mean like the first thing that I can think is his face. I can’t think of anything else right now, but I don’t know. Maybe because it’s only one month and a half and we are together. Before… it’s not what I was thinking. But yeah. Ideally it would be my soulmate, to be able to sleep and wake up with him.
<br><br>
>>>It’d be the same, for both?
<br><br>
Yeah.


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/dora/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Like a moment in my life? Like a period. I think the happiest and the scariest moment in my life, it was the same. It was the moment I decided to do what I wanted, to chase my dreams. I realized how huge a responsibility that is, to choose what you want and be responsible about it, and chase it. So it’s terrifying also. And be alone in another country, without speaking the language perfectly. Without having any connections. That was terrifying. But from the other side, it was so liberating that you are able to do. You realize your power. So when it started manifesting in my life, it was the happiest moment.
<br><br>
>>>That’s so fascinating.  Such a good story.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah. It’s a cliché. (laughs)


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
When I was a child, I was very creative. I thought that I would be an artist. I was sure about it, and I was creating things from nowhere. I was making clothes for my dolls. I was making frames for my pictures. I was experimenting a lot in my garden with different materials. I was very happy doing that, and I was sure I would do something like that in the future. But finally, as I told you I was studying something totally different. I was so depressed. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) You were looking at numbers out of all things! 
<br><br>
Yeah, I was so lost. So now, I would say to my childhood that maybe I finally did it. I’m very close to my dream, or at least half of it. At least when I was at Gaultier, I was very creative. I was working for the couture collection. I was taking the most expensive materials that they had,  mixing them together, trying to create a different texture, fabric, technique... And that was very liberating for me. What I loved to do. Now, in the real world, it is less creative, but still it has to do with that. So I think yeah, I’m close to my childhood dream.
<br><br>
>>>All right.
<br><br>
And then my dream now? I think what I told you. To travel and learn new things, new techniques. Always connected to what I want, what I wanted as a child. I think this is my dream.
<br><br>
>>>Great!! 
<br><br>
I will call you in Japan and see you. And I will do that. (laughs)
