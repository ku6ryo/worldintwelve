    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    [Age] Ezgi: 29, Baris: 34　[Years in Paris] Ezgi: 6, Baris: 9<br>
     <br>  

Ezgi and Baris were introduced me through Shu. Ezgi and Baris are a Turkish couple, and I had an amazing time with them drinking and eating in one of the more niche areas of Paris. It was also my first encounter with traditional but unfamiliar Turkish eats, iskembe soup and lahmacun (both which I would be eating plentifully in Istanbul lol). Talking with Ezgi and Baris was plainly put, so much fun. Both are true intellectuals, with deep knowledge on various topics, and held unique opinions that they were wiling to share. It might have been the first 12 Questions where the entirety truly felt like a conversation at a dinner gathering, and I think the “back and forth-ness” or “live” quality can be felt even through the transcribed words below. It was definitely one of the instances where I was laughing from beginning to end. So as you might imagine, yes all the answers were great, full of thought and identity. I would say its worth 10 minutes of your day reading the whole thing, but if I had to choose, they would be the representations (Q.3), the images (Q.5), marriage/children (Q.9), and dreams (Q.12). So Ezgi, Baris see you guys around, and please make it over to Japan and we can do the whisky tour!!!  

</p>

    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
 Baris: We are in Paris right now in Strasbourg Saint Denis. It’s a good place because it’s a mixed neighborhood. It’s a cool place to be. It’s calm. People accept each other here. It’s nice. And it’s where we feel at home. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: I like this neighborhood because this is maybe the last “Parisian” neighborhood you can have in Paris.
<br><br>
>>>I guess that has to do with the definition of Parisian but we’ll get to that later. (laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah. We’ll get to that. 

 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/ezgiandbaris/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 Baris: Alone or together?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Together.
<br><br>
>>>You can do whatever you want.
<br><br>
Ezgi: We have 2,000 each? (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: Answer now because you are going alone.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I would go to Japan as we spoke earlier.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah because one of my destinations right now, I would choose Japan. If the ticket is paid. And it’s all my pocket money, I would want to stay there for a month.
<br><br>
>>>What is it that’s good about Japan? 
<br><br>
Ezgi: It’s so far away from where I live. (Leo laughs) And the culture is so different. I’ve been in Europe, I visit most of the same countries in Europe. 
<br><br>
[Drinks arrive, and conversations in French with the waiter]
<br><br>
>>>Got cheers on camera.
<br><br>
Ezgi: So yeah, Japan for me.
<br><br>
Baris: There’s so much. I don’t have a specific place. I mean I have most places I want to go, I would say Peru.
<br><br>
>>>Peru?  What would you do?
<br><br>
Baris: Because I want to meet local Peruvian people. Do some Ayahuasca with them and a month is perfect period to do it. You know? Like, once every week. This has been on my mind since… ten years now.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, wow.
<br><br>
Baris: Since I came to Paris actually. But I would like to go to Scotland for a whisky tour as well, to go to Japan with my wife. Go to India. I mean, there’s lots of places. This is a specific question but as you included the 2,000 euro budget.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I wouldn’t handle in Japan but 2,000 euros, I –
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>You wouldn’t be living lavishly (laughs). 
<br><br>
Ezgi: (laughs) Yeah.
<br><br>
Baris: Exactly. I would probably go to Scotland with 2,000 euros and do a distillery tour around like, one month.
<br><br>
>>>That’d be great. That would be awesome. I’d wanna see that. (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah. Try –
<br><br>
Ezgi: Iceland, maybe?  I want to go. Iceland as one of my destinations 
<br><br>
Baris: Iceland as well.


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Ezgi: Italy. Or Greece! For me, Greece.
<br><br>
>>>Ah, why is that?
<br><br>
Ezgi: My father’s from Greece.
<br><br>
>>>Oh! (Ezgi and Baris laugh) Okay, okay, okay.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I spent half of my life in Greece and Yeah. I know Greece very well and I feel home when I go there. And I feel really just like happy when I get to Italy as well. The moment I get in the airport, the moment I get in the bus, and I hear people speaking in Italian, I say, okay. This is why I’m here. I don’t worry about anything.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I feel really safe and I don’t know. The weather is good. People are friendly. Would be like, Italy, maybe.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah. That’s a good question. Well, I mean the question is…it invites sort of stereotypes into the conversation because how can you know a culture, a country, that you don’t belong to? I mean when you say Italian, we all think easy going people. You know, friendly people. Warm-blooded people. There’s that only stereotypes.
<br><br>
>>>But that’s the purpose of the question. Because why do you feel? It’s not your home.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah. I would probably say Greece as well because… we’ve sort of been there. I’ve been a couple of times to Greece and I like the people. I like the music. I like the food. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: The lifestyle.
<br><br>
Baris: Lifestyle.
<br><br>
Ezgi: You know what Turkish people call Greek people? This is what I read somewhere. Is annoying half-brother. (Baris and Leo laugh) Basically coming to the same two parents. One of the parents is the same and we don’t get along, maybe. But we still... you know.
<br><br>
>>>You share the same blood, a little bit. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, just a little. (Baris and Leo laughs)

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/ezgiandbaris/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Ezgi: In Paris?
<br><br>
>>>This is where we get back to what you were saying, Parisian. (laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: So what best represents Paris?
<br><br>
>>>What thing and place do you think best represents Paris?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Saint-Germain.
<br><br>
Baris: Oh. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Saint-Germain, the neighborhood.
<br><br>
Baris: Any piece of shit on the road. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: You can’t say that!! 
<br><br>
Baris: No, I mean, because it is a symbol of Paris. Shit is a symbol of Paris. Well, and it’s been done. I’m not the first one who said. There’s even a book called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/A-Year-Merde-Stephen-Clarke/dp/1582346178">“A Year in the Merde”</a>. (Leo laughs) It’s about an English guy living one year in Paris. No, no, I’m just joking.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Saint-German is a very typical Parisian neighborhood.
<br><br>
Baris: It’s touristy. I mean, it doesn’t seem –
<br><br>
Ezgi: That’s the most Parisian thing you can do. It depends on what you take for Paris. For me, when for instance, people come to visit us, I’ll take them to Saint-Germain. I don’t bring them here in Strasbourg Saint Denis. I love this neighborhood, but when you have your mother or my mother coming here. We don’t bring them here. (Leo laughs) We take them to Saint-Germain.
<br><br>
Baris: We never took my parents to Saint-Germain. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: We had a dinner with your parents St. Germain with your aunt!
<br><br>
Baris: With my aunt, yes?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah. (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: She’s not my parents. (Everyone laughs) Or I don’t remember it. Okay.
<br><br>
Ezgi: But I like it now. I never go there. I never liked it.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.
<br><br>
Baris: I would choose… Place Franz Liszt. There’s a place called Place Franz Liszt near Garre du Nord. It’s basically the house where Franz Liszt lived.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really?
<br><br>
Baris: A Polish composer and piano player. 
<br><br>
>>>I used to play a lot of Liszt.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah? There’s a beautiful church in front of it as well. I would probably take that. Why? Because it symbolizes other people from other cultures coming into Paris because he gave his name to it. If you have something to bring into the culture, you are really accepted. And that’s why I think it’s a good symbol of Paris, actually. You can give your name to a place. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Ezgi: I’m not really… It’s three colors. I would add some flowers. (Baris and Leo laugh) No, no! Because there’s different flowers for each city in France. (Baris and Leo say “Oh!”) Each city has its flower. Each region, probably, has its flower. Or maybe because there’s the fleur-de-lis they call, which is a symbol of French noble families.
<br><br>
Baris: Okay.
<br><br>
>>>That’s so cool. That is such a cool idea.
<br><br>
Ezgi: They used to use this but since it’s a republic, and they don’t use that. 
<br><br>
Baris: Before they were a republic, they used, I didn’t know this.
<br><br>
Ezgi: They detached from this idea of having a symbol of noble family.
<br><br>
>>>Yours might be used for the exhibit. We might make that flag. (Baris laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: You can search for it! They have, the fleur-de-lis, they have different flowers for the North. They have for the South. I would add some different kind, like a flower which grows everywhere in France, maybe, and use this as a symbol of France. I would have to say.
<br><br>
Baris: Nice.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Or wine! Grape. (Everyone laughs) Or something like that! I don’t know.  I would add this in the middle.
<br><br>
Baris: It’s a difficult question but…I was going to say I would put <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=Brigitte+Bardot&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDjumgrabKAhXDKpQKHdMWCXYQ_AUIBygB&biw=1239&bih=667">Brigitte Bardot’s young version</a> on the flag but no. Because you know it’s a symbol of love (Ezgi and Leo laugh) But…(thinking)…  I don’t know. Something about wine, maybe. Two glasses of wine. (Ezgi and Leo laugh) Doing ching, ching, you know? Yeah.
<br><br>
Ezgi: For example, I know that the blue still symbolized the noble blood. I don’t know, it was the color of Paris as well. The blue is the color of Paris as well.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Baris: Okay. I have something.
<br><br>
>>>Go ahead.
<br><br>
Baris: There’s a guitar player called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Metheny">Pat Metheney</a>, maybe you know?
<br><br>
>>>Yes, Pat Metheney. 
<br><br>
Baris: Once, I had this vision of a concert of Pat Metheney on an island in the ocean. (Leo laughs) On a beach. It’s the first impression I get.
<br><br>
>>>What about you, Ezgi?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Mine is more… whales. (Leo laughs) Oceans and there’s whales. I’ve never been to an ocean. It’s always like seas or…
<br><br>
Baris: We saw an image of a blue whale.
<br><br>
Ezgi: A whale, maybe like a blue whale. Reminds me of a blue whale.
<br><br>
---The Sun<br>
Baris: Japan! (laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Asahi!! (Eveyone laughs) 
<br><br>
Baris: There was a movie called “The Sun” which I don’t forget. Who’s that Russian guy who did?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Ah, oh.
<br><br>
Baris: Jodorowsky!!
<br><br>
Ezgi: No.
<br><br>
Baris: I think its Jodorowsky, yeah. It’s a film about the last Japanese Emperor. It’s called “The Sun.”
<br><br>
Ezgi: No! It’s not Jodorowsky. 
<br><br>
Baris: I thought it was Jodorowsky?.
<br><br>
Ezgi: No, no. 
<br><br>
Baris: Sokurov?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Sokurov. Alexander Sokurov.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah, yeah. It was a difficult movie to watch. Even the colors that he… and the lenses and filters that he chose were really depressing but it left a mark on me, let’s say. Yeah, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(film)">“The Sun”</a>. I like that movie. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: And for me is, I don’t like sun. It gives me allergies. (Ezgi and Baris laugh) I like being in heat. I like summer but I don’t like being in the sun. Really, I don’t like it, I prefer being in shade. And to me, it’s allergies and –
<br><br>
Baris: You wanna taste this? It’s really good. [Referring to his whisky]
<br><br>
Ezgi: And burning. Me or him? Me?
<br><br>
Baris: Two. Both of you.
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Ezgi: (Thinking) I don’t mind for me, but I don’t want another person to die. It’s just something I always… For example, I’m not scared of death for me. Everybody’s gonna die and I’ll be dead, I don’t care. But I don’t want to live the death of other people.
<br><br>
Baris: Oh, nice.
<br><br>
Ezgi: That’s the thing I’m scared of.
<br><br>
Baris: She doesn’t want to live the death of other people. People you love.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Of people I love and I recently…well not recently, it’s been two and a half years now, but my grandfather died. And it was the closest person whoever died to me. And I wasn’t in Turkey so they called me to say that he died. And since then I said that, I’m so scared that people around die and not for me. I don’t want to live this mind. I don’t want to live this. To me, it’s stressful. For me? I don’t care. I can die. I don’t mind. I’m not scared.
<br><br>
Baris: Umm… It’s a big universe, you know? I don’t think that dying or living, even, is that important for me. I mean, for me it is because I’m living. I’m in the moment but I think, objectively, okay? I’m not an atheist but let’s say I’m an agnostic. And I don’t believe that death itself is a big deal. I mean, if I’m gonna die, if you’re gonna die. Shouldn’t be a big problem. (laughs) People exaggerate it.
<br><br>
Ezgi: It’s not a bad thing itself,  that’s now what’s scary. It’s what you’re gonna leave afterwards because death, this is what scares people actually. They don’t want to remember. The problem is you remember these people, they have this memory, and you’re not with them. That what scares most of the people, I think.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah, it’s an instinct. It’s an instinct.
<br><br>
Ezgi: For me, it’s this. 


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Baris: Well, I’m not really optimistic. I mean, it’s cliché, I know, but my view of the future is there’s going to be like ten, 15 people living in total freedom and the other billions of people are gonna be either slaves, dead or (thinking)… in chains or whatever, you know?
<br><br>
>>>One of the most depressing ones I’ve gotten so far. (Ezgi laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: It is going to, though.  
<br><br>
Ezgi: We just talked about in the subway before we come here.
<br><br>
>>>Oh really?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah. This is what we talk about in the subway. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: (Thinking)… I mean there are people who say that technology explosion’s gone up and in around 30, 40 years, and we’re gonna be immortal. We’re gonna merge with computers and that kind of thing?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Singularity.
<br><br>
Baris: It’s called singularity. Maybe you know it. You probably know it. I don’t think… maybe even if that doesn’t happen, okay… There are some kinds of areas of technology which are accelerating indefinitely. And my view is that the rich people are going to have in 20, 30 years, real power that we don’t even, can’t even imagine right now, okay? And they’re going to control the world in a way that we won’t even be aware of.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.
<br><br>
Baris: It’s gonna be like interstellar travel, okay? They’re going to put themselves into a state of mind, or state of power that everything will change in less than a second because most of them are psychopaths. (Ezgi and Baris laughs) Okay? That’s my vision of the future. And most probably in 10 or 15 years, we’re going to have a big war as well. And I’m not quite sure of this, but it’s a possibility.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Me, it’s more like personal. (Baris and Leo laugh) For me, the future, my future, should be something that I’ll be happy with, and I’m trying to build that future for me. I don’t mind having money and luxury and I don’t know. A house, of course. But in the future, if I stop for a second in the future, and say “am I happy?” And if I can say “I’m happy” then, okay. I can keep with that. That’s the thing I want to do. I can be in Paris. I can be in Istanbul. I can be in New York or Tokyo. But as someone I wake up in the morning and say, is everything okay for me? I check. Okay. Am I alive? Healthy? Okay. Am I with someone I love? Okay. Do I have enough money to survive? Okay. Then it’s fine. This is the future. My future should be this way. Otherwise, yeah, maybe be all be dead [looks over at Baris] (Baris and Leo laugh) But we’ll die all happy. I want to die happy. (Ezgi and Baris laugh)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/ezgiandbaris/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Ezgi: For me, it would be health and yeah. Health and what brings me happiness as well. Happiness and health. Or in general or the world, I hope for the world, self sufficience. For people being self sufficient. And that’s the most important thing for people not being or demanding more than what they need. The moment that people can be self sufficient we can have our life in order to do good, and things will go better for me. It’s a problem. How do you say [says Turkish word]?
<br><br>
Baris: Greedy.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Greedy! Not being greedy.
<br><br>
>>>Okay.
<br><br>
Baris: That’s a very good answer, actually.
<br><br>
>>>That is a good answer.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah. I was gonna say honesty. That everybody should be honest.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. Honesty.
<br><br>
Baris: Honesty but honesty to yourself as well. If you’re not happy, just accept it.
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) That’s a really good answer!
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah because I see a lot of people, especially in big cities, you know? Who are really not happy. And they are trying to be happy or… politicians, you know? Basically.  Leo (laughs) If they were honest…
<br><br>
>>>They wouldn’t be politicians. Oh snap! (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, let’s not go there. (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: So yeah but I think Ezgi’s answer is better. 

</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Ezgi: (Laughs) You first! You first! (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: I was expecting something about Paris! (Everyone laughs) (Thinking)… What do I look for in a partner? You shouldn’t expect anything from life like that.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that’s a good one.
<br><br>
Baris: I mean, everybody is different and you have to see… I mean, I would probably expect them to surprise me a lot. To be intelligent and have empathy. That’s the most important few things for me. Other things that, I mean, these are really broad not really specific things like being beautiful or, I don’t know. Being caring, or whatever. Yeah, I would say be these three things and the rest will probably take care of itself. I don’t know. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, I would say probably… surprising, yeah and intelligent. And I should share some state of mind with these people so I can just spend my time with happily. And I don’t mind having spending my every day and every minute with this person, but if I’m with the person, we’re having fun. We have interesting things to talk about and laughing about. And this person should add some things to me. I should be learning things from this person. I should be completing my blanks with this person, and that’s what we do. (Ezgi and Baris laughs)

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/ezgiandbaris/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
[Children]<br>
Ezgi: No… It’s an idea but I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t like children a lot. That’s the problem. 
<br><br>
>>>Why is that?
<br><br>
Ezgi: I like children. But for ten minutes it’s okay. (Baris and Leo burst into laughter) I’m not a really children person. That’s the thing. Everybody’s telling me once you get your children, it’s going to be different. But then if I don’t like children, why do you expect me to have children? So I can love them? That’s it but there’s also this idea of being a family because I love my family. I want to continue to have a family. If I can do this with a dog? (laughs) It will be perfect but.
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) If the dog can keep your name, right? 
<br><br>
Ezgi: Exactly.  Yeah, it’s a dog but yeah, maybe it’s not more like a pressure we have from our families as well. I don’t know. I have this one relative who’s like, you’ve gotten married? When’s the children? 
<br><br>
>>>Are you newlywed? When did you get married?
<br><br>
Ezgi: This year! This summer.
<br><br>
Baris: Three months ago.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, but we’ve been together more than six years now.
<br><br>
Baris: Six years, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>I can see that the parents are starting to get a little fidgety in their seats? (laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah! You should watch our wedding we video. Everybody’s talking about this. When are you gonna get children? When are you gonna get children?
<br><br>
>>>Mom is like, when am I gonna get to see my grandbaby?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Exactly. I can have children but I should… not now. I don’t see it right now.
<br><br>
Baris: What was the question again?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Do you wanna have children?
<br><br>
>>>Actually, the main question is what would you wanna do with your children or how do you envision them to become? But the thing is, if it’s before that. You have to want first, so this is actually the main part of it.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Do you want children more than I do?
<br><br>
Baris: Yes.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Oh yeah, he wants it. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: I want to have three children and play music with them.
<br><br>
>>>All right. So you just answered the whole thing (Baris and Leo laugh)
<br><br>
Ezgi: I don’t want to live my life less because I have children. I don’t want to sacrifice many things from my life for my children. Because I’ll be angry to them. (Leo laughs) Yeah! Like, I didn’t do this, that, that because I had to have you. Otherwise… I want to live a peaceful life and say okay, now I’m happy. I can have children to go on. And that’s what I think. We should get rich soon. That’s the problem. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
>>>I don’t want children, I want money! (Everyone laughs) 
<br><br>
Ezgi: If we have money, I could have children! No no, just kidding. 
<br><br>
>>>Okay. Is that okay? I’ve gotten yours. Yours is I want to play music with them.
<br><br>
Baris: (Laughs) But…Though it’s not as simple as that. What if they don’t like music? (laughs) That’s a big one. Fuck off! (Everyone laughs) No, but it’s a big responsibility. I’m also afraid of having children as well.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I’m also afraid something is going to happen to them. There’s always that. I don’t care about myself. I would worry for them. That’s one of the things, actually.
<br><br>
>>>That’s true. I’ve never gotten that.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Being worried all the time. I’m thinking about my parents. That’s why we talk a lot.
<br><br>
Baris: Well, I think women are mostly like that. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: That’s why I’ll talk to my mom, father, so often. I just think about it. They should be worried all the time. That’s the thing.
<br><br>
>>>Huh. I never thought of that.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I don’t wanna live like that. If I call the baby. Is he hungry? If he gets sick? I know this baby. He got cancer. He has leukemia. He’s one year old, okay. He got better. He’s okay but… thinking about this for my baby. I’m a handicapped person. I don’t know if you realized. I only have one hand. I’m wearing a prosthesis.
<br><br>
>>>I never even noticed that.
<br><br>
Ezgi: For me, the worst thing that could happen to my children is that he or she is handicapped.
<br><br>
>>>Oh.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Because I know. I lived this. I have a real nice life. I have everything, but I know what it is to be. So if somebody says that you’re children’s gonna be healthy, all full equipment, and nothing, no problem. Then okay. That’s what worries me the most actually. You can have a nice healthy baby born. When it’s three, two years old, you realize he has autism. There’s all the things that the more you learn about, more you worry about it. 
<br><br>
>>>I never thought of it that way but that’s very, very legitimate. Okay. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: It’s not instinctive. “Let’s have a baby.” You have to talk about it.
<br><br>
Baris: You don’t have to be so pessimistic, though. (Leo bursts into laughter) When you get on a plane, you have a small percentage of dying.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, it happens.
<br><br>
Baris: You know?
<br><br>
Leo: But no, what Ezgi is saying makes sense. I don’t put my opinion up usually but it makes sense. Because what she’s been saying this entire time is the fact that it’s not about herself. The plane, you might die, but that’s okay. Child? That’s somebody else that might have to suffer.
<br><br>
Ezgi: That’s the thing, yeah.
<br><br>
Baris: Makes sense.

<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Ezgi: Sunshine, because I miss to wake up in sunshine in Paris. In winter. You wake up, it’s dark. You come home, it’s dark. You go to sleep, it’s dark. I would say living in a normal season, sunshiny-ness? I would wake up to sunshine but at no obligation. And open my eyes and see sunshine. Big windows and having a nice sun. 
<br><br>
>>>What about go to sleep?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Him? Maybe, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Good answer.
<br><br>
Baris: Nice.
<br><br>
>>>That’s simple enough.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I see him every night.
<br><br>
Baris: Nice.
<br><br>
>>>And Baris? 
<br><br>
Baris: (Thinking)… Now, I have to answer…[looks at Ezgi](Everyone laughs) 
<br><br>
Ezgi: I know you want to see me! (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: I mean both of the times it’s just the feeling that everything is fine, you know? (Thinking)… No apocalypse. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, you are talking in general about everything. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. Not the future you’re imagining. (Laughs) You don’t wake up to that.
<br><br>
Baris: Exactly. Exactly.

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Ezgi: I have many. When I got into the university, when I learned that I’m coming to France for university was a happy moment. When I met him, I remember the moment I saw him, it was a very happy mood and I looked at him and I said I’m gonna see this guy a lot. (Leo laughs) I said to myself I’m going to see him a lot. It was a happy moment. (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: (Laughs) Nice.
<br><br>
Ezgi: I got my French citizenship lately. That was a happy moment. I opened the envelope. I said great, I got it! Terrible moments? As I talked about, when I lost my grandfather, because this was the only that I remember having around. Just the closest person. I lost my uncle but I was really young so it was a little blurry for me. And my grandfather is the person I knew the longest. Like, he was 85 from when I opened my eyes, I knew him. I saw him almost every day before I came to France. It was the most unhappy and the worst day of my life when they called me for this. 
<br><br>
Also, he [Baris] has a chronic disease, and when I learned about his chronic disease, I was worried about this. Yeah. I cried a lot. [Looking at Baris] You didn’t know that.  Because he lost weight. He has this bowel chronic disease.
<br><br>
Baris: Bowel.
<br><br>
Ezgi: How do you call?
<br><br>
Baris: It’s like Crohn's Disease. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: Crohn's.
<br><br>
>>>Oh yeah.
<br><br>
Ezgi: It’s not Crohn's disease but like.
<br><br>
Baris: Ulcerative colitis.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Ulcerative colitis. And we didn’t know that for a long time. He was suffering from it. He was in crisis mode. He was having a crisis. And we didn’t know what was that? And I was scared it was cancer.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah, we were scared it was cancer.
<br><br>
Ezgi: He lost weight, and then we learned. We did a test and everything. It was fine and he’s taking his medicines and everything. And everything is under control but the moment was really, really hard for me.
<br><br>
Baris: Happiest moment in my life, I think it was the day we got married?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Excellent. You hated that! (Everyone laughs) Because for such a long time, you said let’s not do this!
<br><br>
Baris: I thought it was going to be really bad but it was really good. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: The one in Paris or in Istanbul?
<br><br>
Baris: Both were really good but the one in Istanbul was really good.
<br><br>
Ezgi: That was fun.
<br><br>
Baris: I think it was more because you know you have all the people up there.
<br><br>
Ezgi: And they’re coming for you.
<br><br>
Baris: It was a big day.
<br><br>
Ezgi: 400 people. More than 400 people in Istanbul. Actually, we got married in Paris at Municipality of Vaugirard in Paris.
<br><br>
Baris: We wanted a small marriage. Small wedding but my parents insisted they wanted to call people.
<br><br>
>>>Small is 400 people?
<br><br>
Ezgi: No it became a big wedding.  
<br><br>
Baris: But it was nice.
<br><br>
Ezgi: It was fun.
<br><br>
Baris: It was really nice. (Thinking)… Other happy moments always include music, you know?
<br><br>
>>>Oh, very cool.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah. Yeah. Happiest moments is yeah, mostly music. I remember getting a good applause after a solo. That’s a big kind of motivation in life, or getting a prize. You know, I graduated from a school and I won first prize. That was a good moment. The worst moment? I don’t really remember the worst –
<br><br>
>>>I think Ezgi sort of explained one worst moment for you…
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah, but I wasn’t that worried actually. I was mostly worried when I was getting out of the toilet, that moment.
<br><br>
>>>If you have a bowel disease I must imagine it’s terrible getting out of the toilet. (Baris laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: I recently learned a person I really love a lot, got cancer. That was a pretty shitty moment and I lost a person that I love from cancer as well. Yeah, that’s probably, yes.


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
Ezgi: I always wanted to be an archaeologist when I was young. And my mother, she said, I’m not going to pay for your life, Ezgi. (Leo laughs) You should get a job. You’re gonna pay for yourself. So another dream, I always wanted to win an Oscar. (Ezgi and Baris laughs) For best directing. Not for best actress. I want to be a director. I came to France to study cinema. I get disappointed a lot. It was what I had in mind, though I had small victories as well. I won prizes and stuff. But if I tell me in my childhood? I would say think of something concrete.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. (Baris and Leo laugh)
<br><br>
Ezgi: Not something everybody can be. Think of something that might come handy to you that might be concrete, and do that. That’s what I would suggest to the child. And if I go back to university right now, I would probably study history of art or something because I love this one, but I know that I’m not gonna be able to find somewhere at the job I want to have. And I said to myself, I would just do something like engineering or I don’t know. (Laughs) But I hated it. I like my job.  And you, darling?
<br><br>
Baris: I wanted to be a mathematician when I was young, actually. Not a child but when I was 15. Before that, I wanted to be a musician, conductor mostly.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I see. Classical musician. 
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah. Which I did. I didn’t become a classical musician but I conducted an orchestra, which was enough for me. But mathematician, yeah, I wanted to become a mathematician. (Thinking)… Philosophy of mathematics. I wanted to do that. But I became an engineer which was fairly good as well, because I also play a lot of computer games. I still do. Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell yourself?
<br><br>
Ezgi: Going back.
<br><br>
Baris: I don’t know. Nothing probably. 
<br><br>
Ezgi: You’re doing okay. Okay. (Ezgi and Baris laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Just stand there and you watch (Baris laughs). 
<br><br>
Ezgi: I would say don’t choose cinema.
<br><br>
Baris: Good one. (laughs) Because I was really naughty. I used to break everything.
<br><br>
>>>Do you have goals or dreams now? What’s the final part?
<br><br>
Baris: I want to play better saxophone. Yeah, I want to be more flexible in my body. Yeah, I’m not flexible. I want to do good yoga.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) That’s such a good answer. I want to be more flexible.
<br><br>
Baris: Yeah, yeah!
<br><br>
Ezgi: He’s trying.
<br><br>
Baris: I’m trying.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Every morning! (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>That’s nice! 
<br><br>
Baris: I’m not flexible at all.
<br><br>
Ezgi: He’s not. (laughs)
<br><br>
Baris: What else? What other goals? I would love to travel more. (Thinking)
<br><br>
>>>All right. Ezgi? 
<br><br>
Ezgi: I want to wake up and say I don’t want to regret. I want to like what I do. My job.
<br><br>
>>>You sort of answered that in your future question. (Baris and Leo laugh)
<br><br>
Ezgi: I want to be happy and I don’t want to just come back home and I say I’m tired. I want more discipline with sports because I’m not disciplined at all. I just start and never finish. I want to be able to finish what I start. So my main problem is I get bored. The problem is I get quickly in what I have to do, the next step I don’t get it. Then I don’t want to do it. That’s the thing. And everything loses its interests in my eye. And I want things to. He’s very disciplined. I want to be like this. Like in sports, he goes four times a week to the gym.  Yeah, he does his things in the morning. I just do it for once and say okay. 
<br><br>
>>>His more flexible thing.
<br><br>
Ezgi: Yeah, yeah. I just do it once. Okay, I get it. I don’t want to do it again and that’s my thing, yeah.
