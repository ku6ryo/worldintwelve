    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in Paris: 6<br>
     <br>  
 
Gautier I was introduced at one of Simon’s gatherings with his friends. Gautier is plainly put, a thinker. He is the type of person I imagine was walking around Paris 150, 100, 50 years ago, spending time in the cafes with like minds, discussing philosophy, politics, literature, art, music, and various forms of ideologies. He holds the spirit of Rousseau, Balzac, Bastille, Picasso, Sartre, Diderot, and the countless others that roamed and strived in the city of love. Many of the French people I met (and really all the people I met in Paris) were the thinker type (which is why I love the city and its people, even though Parisians get a bad rep), and Gautier was a defining one. He answered the 12Qs with a process, one in which I felt he was breaking down each question into logical parts, then provided the deep thought that tackled each one. It was one of those occasions where I was thinking just as much as Gautier who was answering the questions. So obviously, I would like readers to take a look at all of them, but if I were to recommend a few, they would be the images (Q.5), future (Q.6), important thing (Q.7), and dreams (Q.12). So thanks Gautier, I know we’ll meet again, and next time, even more deep conversations shall await us!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
We’re in the 13th arrondissement / district of Paris. It’s neighborhood called ”La Butte aux Cailles”. It’s a small hill. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah it is a small hill. (laughs) One of the few hills.
<br><br>
(Laughs) With quite ancient buildings and small streets so it’s very nice to just walk around and hang around here. Go to a restaurant. Go for drinks because it feels cozy. I feel it’s a good place for an interview for these exact same reasons.
 </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Okay. I dream of going to New Zealand because the nature is very unique there. And I’ve read that…[Cafe arrives] Merci. I’ve read that 90 percent of the species that are there—might be false (Leo laughs)—but a lot of the species there only exist there. Like nature is something really unique there, and it’s really amazing how they manage to integrate Maori culture into the dominant culture, say so. And I don’t know. I mean with the Aborigines people of Australia, it’s such a disaster. And in New Zealand they kind of manage to integrate that minority into that. So that’s why. And they’ve got some very good reggae scene. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I never knew that!
<br><br>
Yeah, there’s one band called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7QQS5V3cnI"> Fat Freddy’s Drop</a>. It’s reggae with a touch of electro and soul jazz music. It’s totally amazing. One of my fave bands. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Very cool. I’ll put a link on the website and listen to it.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Okay. But then I would feel guilty about the plane because of the carbon footprint of the plane. I’m trying to take the plane as little as possible. So maybe if I didn’t take the possibility of taking the plane into account, maybe I’d just go to, I don’t know. London. I can see London. I find it quite fascinating. It’s quite a twin sister of Paris. (laughs)

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Oh my God. I feel so French, actually. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
>>>That’s such a… (laughs) I’ve never gotten that before. (laughs)
<br><br>
(Laughs) No, really… (thinking)… I feel the culture running inside of me and some of that. It’s really something deep. And so which country do I feel the closest to? Well I’m a German speaker, and I did this French-German bachelor and I spent one year in Germany but yet, I wouldn’t say I feel closest to Germany. (Leo laughs) I don’t know, maybe the culture or something.
<br><br>
>>>No, it’s very, very different.
<br><br>
And what country? I love speaking English. I do love that. I love British culture. I love the way people are there.
<br><br>
>>>I mean, you chose New Zealand which is English speaking. 
<br><br>
Yeah. I can fully relate to it. So maybe Great Britain, yeah.

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/gautier/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Wow. I could tell you about places I love in Paris, but what place represents? What place and thing?
<br><br>
>>>It can be, sometimes the thing and place could be the same thing. It’s up to you.
<br><br>
Yeah, sure. (Thinking)… Wow. Oh my God. Let me think. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Take your time.
<br><br>
(Thinking)… Thing? (More thinking)  <br><br>
>>>[After about 90 seconds of silence] Oh, you’re really thinking now.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Paris is other things to me. I’m afraid I can’t summarize it.
<br><br>
>>>Okay. That works too. 
<br><br>
Sorry.
<br><br>
>>>There’s just too many? For both place and thing? You can’t choose one?
<br><br>
Yeah, maybe… what it represents is Paris is the subway. Paris is the cafes. Paris is… curves because they are… (thinking)… There’s not really a big square where you can hang around Paris. It’s specificity. 
<br><br>
>>>The sidewalks are huge. 
<br><br>
Yeah. But there’s bad sidewalks too (laughs).

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
Wow. (Thinking)… I think white stands for royalty, historically speaking. Red must stand for the people. And blue, which is also a color for royalty, and must stand for something but maybe I’m getting it mixed up. (Thinking)… I don’t know. Maybe we should make something more open to the world. You know, on the Brazilian flag, there’s a globe. (Leo laughs) I love that. The flag should show that. France is open to the world so maybe we should curve the blue and the red stripes so that the white section becomes a globe.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean. Brittany. Brittany. Because when I used to be a child, my mom, she would take us to a family home in Brittany, so my ocean is basically the Atlantic Sea, and I’ve built a very strong relationship to that place. And I would love going back to live at the sea side someday. So yeah. The Atlantic Sea is the one ocean I love. And I love nature in Brittany because it’s very well preserved. There’s not many buildings on the shore and stuff, so it seems quite wild. I guess that’s why I love it.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Heat. (Laughs) Heat. Of course. And… I like the sun, of course, but there are people who can only, who can never get enough sun. They’re like, oh, winter, life is so ruined. And then summer it’s so amazing and stuff. But when it’s too hot, when I feel I get too much sun, I also feel it as a bit of discomfort and it can even get depressing. So it’s heat and the sun is the sword with the blades on it. (Laughs) It can be annoying to me. I like the rain too. I like the melancholy side of the rain, and my favorite season is autumn, so I’m not worshipping the sun like some people do.
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Gautier: Hmm… (Thinking)… A dark place. It’s death… like an anti-place. It’s all black, is what it consists of, but it’s infinite and maybe you can slightly see a dense smoke or something. And you have to wander restlessly through that smoke. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s great. Very interesting image. So it’s like being surrounded by this smoke and you’re just kind of endlessly wandering?
<br><br>
Yeah. 



 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
(Thinking)… I’m very worried about climate change.
<br><br>
>>>You were talking about carbon footprints, so yeah.
<br><br>
Yeah. Well, it’s something like… it’s a meta problem. It’s irreversible and it lasts forever. Or at least as far as the humans can conceive time, it’s gonna be forever into next ice age but. 
<br><br>
>>>Until it all crumbles. 
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah. Right. And I’m worried about it because it takes reciprocity, you know? And we don’t have a worldwide government that can impose measures on us, and the conference and stuff, it’s been a failure for the last 20 editions. [This interview was conducted before the COP21 in Paris in November, 2015]
<br><br>
>>>Yes.
<br><br>
And I think that change has to come from citizens. It has to come from civil society, because if we wait for the governments to move, then we’re done for. And I used to have that idea that it could all end up as a major apocalypse, like with food shortages and people starting to fight each other, and all that very dark imagery. But I also think that history can change so fast and if it can change so fast as to cause an apocalypse, then it can change as to cause major awareness. People are becoming aware of stuff. 
<br><br>
Look at what happened with the migrant refugee topic in France. There’s this huge move of solidarity across Europe although it’s not dreamland. It’s not hegemonic. There are also counter-opinions and voices but what has happened is great. It’s like miracles at once. Conservative right wing, liberal Merkel saying at once, hey, I’m the master here. I’ll do what I want. Let’s welcome thousands and thousands of refugees so I was like, yeah. Shit yeah. (Laughs) So maybe there’s just no longevity in the movement, but only the fact that it can happen punctually and the demonstration being quite spontaneously organized in Paris, even with a few thousand people attending. That’s it. That stuff’s going on. So hope is love. And I don’t even know whether one should be pessimistic of it or optimistic, one should be pragmatic and just try to do the very little they can. The very little they’re able to do, or whatever they’re able to contribute. To struggle on that climate change topic. [Speaks French] What one has to do is to do the very, very little they’re capable of and that’s it. Wow, I’ve been talking too much.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/gautier/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Well, as I told you when we met on Saturday, the most important thing for me is benevolence.
<br><br>
>>>Yes.
<br><br>
And you told me that a lot of people that take up your question, they answer love. Of course, benevolence includes that but love has a lot of different meanings and sometimes, it means you could focus mainly on your kinfolk, like family and friends. Benevolence, it’s a broad term, and it means you can try to be benevolent towards the people you don’t manage to love. Because I think that, ideally, one should be able to feel love for one, just because they are human, and they have the possibility of enlightenment within them. As Buddhism says. But you can’t be a great person for all the time, but at least you can try to well, be empathic and try to figure out what you would do if you were in this or that person’s place. And “oh, he or she’s reacting like that because blah, blah, blah”. Okay, what would help him or her could be that I did that, so let’s try that out. It’s the most difficult thing to do in the world. I mean maybe I don’t even manage to do that one time out of ten. But it’s definitely worth trying.
<br><br>
>>>To hold that mentality. Wow. Very true. 


</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Wow. (Thinking)… I’m looking for a good looking person. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Important. Important.
<br><br>
But also I’m looking for a very deep… how do you call it? Very deep connection. (Thinking)… I… kind of dream of a relationship. Of course talking is the most important thing for a relationship to last, but I kind of dream of a relationship where you and the other person get along together so well. You’re so strongly connected that sometimes, you don’t even have to speak. And the other person understands what you feel. It’s very important to have a strong connection. And it’s funny because essentially, I’m not so much looking for passion. <i>That</i> passion. (Leo laughs) That makes you feel electric when you see the other person. That intensity.
<br><br>
>>>You’re in the city of love, though. (Laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah, I know. Love, of course because there’s so many cute girls out here.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Very beautiful people city.
<br><br>
It’s a very important factor for a city to be enjoyable, whatever. And what else? What was I saying? What was I getting at?
<br><br>
>>>It’s not the electric part. It’s not the passion.
<br><br>
Yeah, the passion thing. Life may be about intensity, but intensity is not maybe always what we think it is. And that passion thing, it’s also a very demanding way to look at a relationship. Maybe I’m demanding, in a way, when I say we should be strongly connected. And you can’t be always connected but it’s also very demanding to ask for passion all the time. We should be always “wow”, amazed, you’re sent in another world when you look at the other person. If I can find a person where I’m more looking for proper “love”, which I would define as the desire to deeply understand, and do good and take care of the other person. That passion thing is where you’re always bringing in something new to the relationship, and I feel that can be well… I take that. I receive that as a demanding thing and I think that can be quite exhausting and I don’t know. That passion thing, like falling madly in love and being devastated afterwards. I mean, you’re already devastated enough when you get dumped after a normal relationship. (Both laugh) Well I’m afraid that’s a not a sexy way to look at it but that’s how I feel.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/gautier/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
[Marriage] No because marriage doesn’t mean something to me.<br>
[Children] (Laughs) Tough question because basically, I would reply I don’t want children.
<br><br>
>>>Can you explain that.
<br><br>
Yeah, sure. I think having children is a huge responsibility. And I kind of feel like if I had children, then it’s not the same as with some people, that it’s a desire that comes very spontaneously. They don’t even have to think about it. They’re like, “sure, I want to get children? Of course!”
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Yeah.
<br><br>
And I’m not free in that way so I have to “intellectualize” it. (Leo laughs) And I’m thinking like, of course, it’s great to meet a new person and watch he or she grow up, and the world seen through the eyes of children is totally fascinating. And it reminds you of a lot of stuff that you have forgotten while growing up, which is normal, but it’s great to have children. And I guess for a lot of parents, it’s quite… the second youth or something. (Leo laughs) It shows you how to look at the world differently and it’s great. It’s amazing meeting a new person. 
<br><br>
But I feel I would sacrifice years and years of my life just to raise that new person, and I don’t know if maybe that’s selfish, but I don’t know if I’m ready for it, actually. And maybe only if I was with a person that yeah, that kind of love, when you feel you can totally entrust yourself to the person, and feel so deeply connected, maybe I would settle for it because it would be a common project.
<br><br>
>>>I see. 
<br><br>
Because it’s not you, it’s not me, it’s not her that has children. It’s the couple that has children and it’s something that’s totally different. It’s something totally different. And I mean, yeah, it’s with how the couple looks at having children, and not raising them that’s important. It’s not definitive no. Maybe someone can change my mind someday.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
I like to hear noises when I wake up. Like noise of the sea, when you wake up. It’s amazing. And when I was a child, I can remember that I loved to fall asleep while hearing the sound of the water in the pipes while someone was showering downstairs. It had that white-noise property of appeasing me, and slowly bringing me down to sleep.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I understand that. 
<br><br>
So I like that kind of soft noises upon waking up. Oh, noise of the rain. Perfect way to fall asleep. Rain knocking on the windows, that’s… wow. That’s one. 


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/gautier/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Sure. (Thinking)… Well, best moment is easier.
<br><br>
>>>Okay.
<br><br>
Best moment, well, one of the best or… this moment I’m thinking about illustrates just how it happens when I feel deeply happy. It takes me by surprise. It’s not the fact of achieving something, it’s really at all surprise at once. I was back in high school there, I was sitting in the garden at the end of the afternoon sipping some beer with a couple pals of mine. But not really my best friends, just people I enjoy being with, and it was this sunny, I don’t know, spring or summer afternoon. And just so at once, I felt like I was taking some distance with the whole scene and thinking “wow, that’s it”. That’s happiness. I don’t know if it was a perfect moment, but that was happiness. 
<br><br>
Some moments, especially when I’m with friends…just strikes me. I can’t decide and it’s weird, but it’s always been that when I achieved accomplished things, I was quite often disappointed that I didn’t react the way I should have reacted, because when you think that when you’re reaching the summit of a mountain you’re going to be like, gasping at the view and saying wow. And sometimes, it just doesn’t happen, and you have to accept it. And then you’re doing the most common, basic things. And you’re just having coffee or whatever, maybe just at home and there’s nothing special. And wow. I was about to say it strikes you, but I don’t know how it works for other people. But that’s how it strikes me.
<br><br>
>>>I think everybody can relate with that, yeah. Frightening moment? Or terrifying moment? Scary?
<br><br>
Scariest. Scariest. Scary. I’ve got one but it’s quite intimate. I’ll tell it, whatever. Once, I had an unprotected relationship with a girl. And I spent a couple of weeks or even a month, wondering whether I could have AIDS or something, even though I wasn’t doing anything. Because I was living abroad. And then I came back to France, I took a test and… the odds of course were very low but still I was deeply anguished. And it’s fascinating because, even though probably it is slim to none, that freaked me out. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s so true.
<br><br>
I mean, what are the odds that you would get AIDS, you know? It’s so, so, so low.
<br><br>
>>>That’s what phobia is about. People who are scared of going on planes. What’s the chance of the plane crashing?
<br><br>
Yeah, exactly. It’s no reason to fuck around, though. (Leo laughs) Although, that’s probably not the appropriate word.
<br><br>
>>>Actually, that might be the <i>most</i> appropriate word, in a way. (Laughs) 
 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
(Thinking)… Wow. When I was little. (Thinking)… I think until quite recently, maybe until I’ve become adult…  Since I’ve been a teenager or so… I kind of dreamed that I was, or convinced that I would do exceptional stuff. Like I’m going to become a writer, and how it is it that I’m not writing books? Because I’m <i>supposed</i> to be a writer. How come I’m not writing books? Fuck it. I like music a lot. Then I was supposed to become a great musician. I realized my dream was to become an artist, a professional artist I think. And at least it’s the dream that’s remained the longest. (laughs) 
<br><br>
And…(thinking)… I’m asking myself. Do I feel disappointed that I didn’t become some professional musician traveling around the world all the time and having an exciting life? I think I would have loved to have such a life, but also if I didn’t have the nerve to try and risk not eating every day for getting what I wanted, that’s “me” also. And the more time passes away, the more I think about it, that’s the lazy me. That’s the not exceptional me. And what would suck, what I would tell the child I used to be is, what would suck is if I was just bitter of not doing that.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Wow. Yeah.
<br><br>
From not doing that. What sucks is not that I’m not fucking exceptional or whatever, because I am what I am. I am whatever I am, and I would also tell that kid, I’m slowly working on improving things and just good things take time to do. So I’m working on it. Be patient, kid. And my quest is just not doing this or that. The new quest is wisdom. The quest is… I can be exceptional in a way that I’m not trying to be exceptional, I’m just trying to be happy, and a good person. And as for now, there’s no perspective that could be more rewarding to me. I mean, it’s the goal. It’s the goal. It’s the point, is trying to be happy, make other people happy. Try and do good stuff, or at least not do stuff that harms others. And that’s it. And that’s so virtuous, the taking of that challenge is already something big. So I’m going to hang onto that.
