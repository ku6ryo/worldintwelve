    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：33　Years in Paris: 10<br>
     <br>  
   Pierre was introduced to me by Shu. Pierre is an architect, but also much more. I got to have a nice brunch with Pierre at one of his favourite cafe’s in the North of Paris, a hole-in-the-wall location with that special atmosphere that can only be felt by shops which are loved by the community. Talking with Pierre was an inspiration because he was basically living what I considered the ideal life. He had his own firm, which is centered around architecture, but also is involved with various art and design projects. He also enlightened me on other subjects, such as the startup scene (or lack thereof) in Paris, along with food (and life in general) in various parts of Paris and France. One of the amazing parts of this project is, plainly put, flat out all the new things I learn everyday, and Pierre gave me a plethora of that! And as you might assume, Pierre gave many amazing answers so its difficult to choose recommendations, but if I had to, they would be the representations (Q.3), the future (Q.6), marriage/children (Q.9), and wake up/go to sleep (Q.10). So thanks for everything Pierre, and I’m sure we’ll meet again, somewhere around the world!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: Well, we are right now at the edge of…well, we’re in the 18th District. We are very close to Mont Martre. It’s a very touristic place. And we are at the edge of touristic and posh district and that is a very popular district. And it’s one of the trendiest in the country. Which is used to be a very popular area. In a minute there is kind of closed social distinction as well. And this coffee shop is kind of one of the last simple and nice places that is around, which I really like. I come here almost every weekend, when I’m here.
<br><br>
>>>The pictures will be on the site. (laughs) When it comes out.
 <br><br>
I recommend it. 
 </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
There’s only one destination, right?
<br><br>
 >>>If you can think you can fit it into one month, then it’s okay to go to other places too. Like I do. 
<br><br>
Well, I would probably do all the things you say “if I had more time I would love to do”.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. (laughs)
<br><br>
Exactly. So one thing I’m trying to do since a long time is I want to learn surfing. And I would love actually to spend just one month surfing somewhere. And probably, if there is enough money, just buy a surfboard and surf all day long. So probably one destination would be… I would go along the coast of Portugal.
<br><br>
>>>Ah, yes! Very good surfing spots, yes.
<br><br>
 And ride from one small surfboard to another like, maybe from Porto to Lisbon, something like that. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that’s very cool.
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s a nice idea. I would really love it.

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
I think I would say Spain.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting. Spain? Why Spain?
<br><br>
It’s like…well, I spent some time close to Spain mostly when I was a teenager. And there is this kind of energy in Spanish people. Not only in Spain but also in the country as well. But I find it [the energy] the closest to me in Spain. It’s like, they have a lot of energy. They have a lot of enthusiasm. They are also very simple and straightforward character. 
<br><br>
>>>Aha.
<br><br>
And I really enjoy this kind of country, and the people who are there. Usually, I get along very well with Spanish people.
<br><br>
>>>That’s very interesting. “I get along well with the people”. People don’t use that for this answer much! (Pierre laughs)


</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/pierre/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Well, I guess if it’s for me, I wouldn’t answer a typical thing like the Eiffel Tower. But one thing that represents Paris would be its food.
<br><br>
>>>Ah cool! 
<br><br>
Because you have of course French cuisine which is amazing but in Paris, you also have it coming from all over Europe. And because I’m kind of a food maniac.
<br><br>
>>>Oh! We can be friends. (Both laugh) 
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s an amazing city [for food]. And then is there a place as well? It’s a thing and a place?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. But I guess it sort of leads to food places? 
<br><br>
Yeah. Food places in Paris. Very diverse and very rich.
<br><br>
>>>I see. Is there one thing that you truly recommend say, to people who are reading this?
<br><br>
Yeah. I would say…(thinking)… Well, basically, there’s nothing like… if you want to combine, if you had a very short time in Paris, and wanted to combine the atmosphere of the city, the experience, you would basically sit at a cafe. You would find a quiet cafe, sit on a terrace, and ask for a small glass of wine. Things like that or something. Which is not so much a cliché, but you would appreciate the space outside. You would appreciate the variety of the food as well, in a very simple way. I think that yeah. I think that’s the thing I would recommend for someone who’s traveling alone, in a place in Paris.  </i>
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
Wow. That’s interesting. Well I would basically…(thinking)… I would not do it as a national flag, but I would probably like, decorate it for my own purpose, or as a joke or something. 
<br><br>
>>>So what would you do with it then?
<br><br>
I would probably make the flag white and put a lot of monkeys on it.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Has to do with your company, right?
<br><br>
Yeah or like, a mutiny. An army of monkeys rising. (Leo laughs) Would be a funny flag.
<br><br>
>>>That would be a great flag! (laughs)
<br><br>
It’s the Planet of the Apes? (laughs) But national.
<br><br>
>>>I can only imagine that flag waving, right? 
<br><br>
Exactly.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
(Thinking)… The ocean. Well, for me, it’s the beach. Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>Is it a specific beach? 
<br><br>
Well, yeah. I grew up in front of the ocean, and I spent my childhood in front of the Mediterranean Sea. So the closest to the ocean I could see was the beach.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
The sun? Well, I would probably say the same thing, but if its that if I would have to find… (thinking)… Yeah, I would say maybe with the sun, for me is the outside. So I would just say enjoying time outside. Whether on a terrace, or at the beach. Probably also something associated with the time you spent with friends, for me. 
<br><br>


—Death<br>
Hm. I would say for me is just, something that I can say is silence and quietness, maybe.



 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Well, I would be very optimistic. I have this discussion with a lot of people.
<br><br>
>>>Huh, interesting.
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s interesting. So it’s a sign of the times? (Leo laughs) When you have big events happening at a worldwide scale, and nobody knows how to handle that, people are either depressed or very optimistic.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) You nailed it! I must say. People are either one or the other! 
<br><br>
Yeah. But I think we’re past this moment of depression. I would be very optimistic. I think we are in a moment where we are just figuring out things, and yeah, that’s a lot of energy. That’s how I see it. There are new things happening. A lot of activities and energy, and I think it’s a very good atmosphere.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. You talked a little bit about today. About Paris. That future too.
<br><br>
Yeah, not only for Paris. I mean on a generalized scale, I think it’s a very interesting moment for young people. For the new generations, I would say, more generally.
<br><br>
>>> The reason is technology, or...? 
<br><br>
Technology but not only. It’s, I mean, of course there is a way to experience the world which is kind of unprecedented but there is a huge transformation. There’s a huge collapse on the former systems. Like, political, economical.
<br><br>
>>>I see. I see. That makes sense.
<br><br>
It’s, when you’re young, you tend to adapt a lot, and deal on this sort of thing. So I think the new generations, and ourselves included have a huge playground actually. 
<br><br>
>>>What a great way of putting it. A huge playground. A flag with monkeys and huge playground!! (Pierre laughs)

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
For me? Sorry. It’s to just learn new things. Just want to learn. I think it’s also a matter of health. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s a very important one.
<br><br>
Both mental and physiological. Just to learn new things, experiences. It’s very important.



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 I would say kind of something, like independent or curiosity. A way to be someone and continuously try to evolve. To evolve and become something new. Yeah, that’s something that’s interesting a lot.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/paris/twelve_questions/pierre/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yeah, why not? It’s not a plan. <br>
Children: As well, why not?
<br><br>
[Second part of question]
<br><br>
Well, I don’t know. I would probably try to… as much as I can, to show them how to experience the world, and not close themselves too much in a path. So I would probably try to make them travel very soon. I would make them learn several languages as soon as possible. Try to get them familiar with technologies and codings as well.
<br><br>
>>>Oh. Interesting.
<br><br>
Kind of literate them as wide as possible so they can experience the world at a range as wide as they can? I think it’s a very important thing when you come into the world to be able to speak, and to act in many different ways. 
<br><br>
>>>Hm. Very cool. Could you elaborate on the coding answer? That’s a very interesting one. It’s important in this era. It’s another form of language.
<br><br>
Exactly. I mean, right now, you need to speak several other languages if you want to work. And if you want to communicate with people. But now, even if you want to communicate with people, you need to speak not only natural languages as well. You need to learn those other languages [referring to coding] which are out. And I think it’s part of the communications skills we build and we need to teach people. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Ah, okay. For me, there’s one thing I love which always makes me go back, and it’s when I go back to south France. I live close to the beach. So… I mean because it’s very related to my childhood, and this moment of quietness and reflection. When I wake up, I just love to have it in front of my face. 
<br><br>
>>>The ocean. The beach.
<br><br>
Yes, the ocean. You have this… I don’t know if you have this kind of discussion with friends as well but it’s like, the discussion either you’re more an ocean person or mountain person? 
<br><br>
>>>I think every culture has that. Japan has that. I don’t know if the US has that, but in Japan, it’s very, very popular. “Are you a mountain person or are you an ocean person?”
<br><br>
Yeah, it’s related to “why do you prefer that, in terms of stability? or explorations?” 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I never thought of that before.
<br><br>
One of my best friends says she’s a mountain person. For her, it’s because the mountain is there, and there is a visual limit. So it’s something stable which stays. It’s very dangerous, but it’s like a reference. A stable point. And for me, ocean is like a notion. It’s like you don’t know what’s in the sea but it’s there. It’s this vast space to explore. But it’s always there. And it has this continuous sound, which is this amazing amount of water in front of you. And for me it’s like, it’s hope but it’s so reassuring in a way. You have this thing in front of you to explore. And I really like to have this in front of me when I wake up. For me, it’s like yeah, it’s a new day.
<br><br>
>>>It has so many meanings to it, when you think about it.
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Basically, every morning not only if you’re looking at the ocean, you’re looking at basically the representation that you’re going to be exploring later.
<br><br>
Exactly. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) So what about before you go to sleep?
<br><br>
Before I go to sleep, I just kind of like to close my mind. So usually, I just like to be in this place where there’s nothing. 
<br><br>
>>>I see.
<br><br>
I try to just make a void in my mind. And in a way, like the day starts with just vast space and stops. I need to shut down and think about other things. It’s a bit more like that.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Well. (Thinking)… I guess the most terrifying one was when I was in architecture studies in my first year. And you know this moment when you just enter the studies, and you’re not especially sure what you’re going to do with your life. And I had this very scary professor. (Leo laughs) In architecture, it was kind of lie “Whiplash” [referring to the movie].
<br><br>
>>>“Whiplash” architecture version!! (laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. An architect professor and she one day told me, I think you’re not meant for architecture. You’re not good for architecture.
<br><br>
>>>Oh!
<br><br>
And so I had this huge doubt in my life. I didn’t know what to do and it was very terrifying. But finally, I thought about it and I said okay, well, “fuck it!!” (Leo laughs)  I mean, this is what I want to do. You don’t know if I’m just a student. I want to give it a try. So I just continued. And it was very terrifying because you have this huge older professor just hitting you. You’re not meant for that and you’re trying to fight. So this was very terrifying. But finally, I managed to step up and do something. So I’m kind of happy about that. To have faced this terrifying moment. Ok for happy moment, I think it’s more… like say I’ve had a lot. I can’t choose like what is the most happiest moment. It’s like… family reunions. Or like, being able to be successful in projects or things like that. It’s too diverse to say. I had many, many happy moments.
<br><br>
>>>That works.
<br><br>
Both personally and professionally. I cannot weight them at the same.


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream. I kind of wanted to be an artist or an architect. And… because I was very good at drawing, painting, et cetera, but I also had an interest for sciences. So this was my dream. But at the same time, I was so very stubborn. So if I would met myself at the same time, I would say just keep going.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, yeah. (laughs) You probably wouldn’t have listened to you anyway, right? (laughs)
<br><br>
Just keep going! You’re gonna find out. 
<br><br>
>>>All right. What is your dream now? Or goal now? You’re doing a lot of interesting things.
<br><br>
My dream now… Yeah, I think, I mean what I’m doing right now is related to my dreams. I think its just… I wish what I’m doing right now with the institute and my office, I wish them to succeed and I hope, no I see things going this way. So yeah. My dream is just… it’s gonna happen. (laughs)
