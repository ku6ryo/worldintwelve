    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in Rio de Janeiro： All but a half a year in Canada<br>
     <br>  
     Caio was introduced to me through his mother, Lillian who is colleague professors with Eve and Alex. Caio was absolutely incredible, meeting up with me numerous times during my stay in Rio. He showed me around the Lagoa, went up the Christ Redeemer, and for the 12 Questions, I got to tag along with him and his girlfriend, Fernanda, to check out the Centro area. We visited the the Bank Museum, saw some amazing architecture, and had a memorable time at the cafe with some delicacies. Caio, being a PhD student in Economics, answered the questions with simplicity and precision; I would recommend his important thing (Q.7), his wake up/go to bed (Q.10), and his dreams (Q.12). So Caio, do come to Japan once with Fernanda, and I will give back and show you all around town!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: Well it's a cafe in here. It's got sweet things and coffee and nice things to eat and to drink.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   I'm not sure but the, the first place that came to my mind was Canada.  I really liked being there, so I think one month there would be nice. 
<br><br>
>>> Is there anywhere in Canada you'd like to go?
<br><br>
Vancouver and the Rockies, of course. 
<br><br>
>>> I see, so you're going to go back to Canada? What is it you like about Canada? 
<br><br>
It’s…so different from here. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) That's pretty true. 
<br><br>
It's all organized, you know, and it's clean, it's clean. 

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  I think Mexico is the closest one. People from Mexico are very similar from the Brazilian people. Besides they being apart from a huge distance like it's North America, but they are the most similar to Brazilians in the world. 
<br><br>
>>>Why do you, what aspects do you think?
<br><br>
I think the culture… they are very happy as well. (Leo laughs) And they embrace others. They are a little bit shorter than us. (Everyone laughs).  I think they are okay, they are nice.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 Oh, place definitely it's the beach. Um thing, I think——what you mean by thing? So it could be a concrete thing? 
<br><br>
>>>No, it doesn't have to be concrete. 
<br><br>
 I'm not sure but I think the “thumbs up”, that, in terms of the spirit. I think the spirit of is pretty good. 
<br><br>
>>>The Carioca thumbs up!! 
<br><br>
Yeah. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   I think I wouldn't. I think I wouldn't. 
<br><br>
>>>Make sure you didn't-she didn't give you your answer. 
<br><br>
No, no. (Leo laughs) I wouldn't because… it represents very well. All of the colors they have meanings you know. The blue represents the sea, the green the trees and the yellow is the Sun and the white, I don't know what, but I believe it's peace or something. (Leo laughs) And… I think it’s… it suits better, it suits okay the Brazilian country. I don't think I would do different.

    <p><em>A5</em><br>
Okay. I think that surfing is the first thing that pops in my mind. What's, what I like to do is I, I spend a lot of time in the ocean surfing. I think the waves are the first thing I think about.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
I think the Sun is like an enemy. 
<br><br>
>>>All right. Why? 
<br><br>
Only, maybe because I'm too white. 
<br><br>
>>>(Everyone laughs) You're too white. That's because you look like you’re Russian, right?
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah, yeah. I think I'm too white for Brazil. (Leo laughs)  I think it's like an enemy. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 I think that's the end you know, of…the life on earth. I don't know what's after death, but it's the end. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
 Yeah, it’s the end.

    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 Um, I'm not sure about mankind, I don't know if I'm going to live enough to see what's going to happen with mankind. We're not in a…nice force right now. But… problems we have to solve like global warming and things like that. Now, my future, it’s confused as well. I don't know if want to accomplish all I wanna accomplish you know, to become a professor or to make a honest living you know with a comfortable house and a family. What I want for the future, I don't know if I'm gonna achieve that soon or not.

 No, no, not exactly. “Walking Dead”, I'm watching “The Walking Dead”, yeah. It's not, that's not a very good idea, you know. It's not a good show to watch before you go to bed yeah. That's okay. 
<br><br>
>>>That's what you're doing right now?

Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now. So…TV would be the answer.
