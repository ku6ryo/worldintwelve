    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in Rio de Janeiro： 26 (Egg Yolk Carioca!!)<br>
     <br>  

     I met Carolina at Luciana’s birthday party. Carolina, now with her really cool startup that lets foreigners and tourists meet up with local Cariocas (you can check it out below, and use it when you go to Rio), is one of those girls with one of those electrifying personalities. You can almost <i>see</i> the positive energy flowing from her. I recall one moment at the party where she asked how people would act at funerals in Japanese culture (whether they’d bow or not, etc.) so I showed her, and in return, she reenacted a Brazilian funeral---it was absolutely one of the greatest acting jobs I’ve seen, with the excessive bawling, hugging, crying and showing of emotion! Carolina, for her shoot, took me to Aterro do Flamengo, which instantly became my favorite spot in Rio. The beach is beautiful, you can play any sport you want, no tourists only Cariocas—to be honest, its so good, I don’t want to post this so everyone doesn’t find out!! Haha. For Carolina’s answers, I recommend the representation (Q.3), the flag (Q.4) which was eye-opening, the future (Q.6), and her moments (Q.11). So Carolina, thanks again, and I hope your service is going well! Come to Japan, and you can wander with me, the “local”!! Haha

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
  Place:  So ! This is Aterro do Flamengo. A place right beside my home. Usually in the mornings, I wake up like a bit before 7 am, and I get my bike at 7 am, and cycle all over here. This is a place that I really enjoy. It’s how I choose to begin my day with, and it energizes me. Connects me to the nature and the city. So… this is one of my favorite places.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 So I need to choose only one place ?
<br><br>
>>>If you think you can go to more than one place in a month, then you do that! 
<br><br>
So…Okay, (Thinking)… At this moment of my life I would choose San Francisco… because I am starting my own company. And, it’s a tech company, a start-up. It’s called LocalWander. And… since all best tech scene is in San Francisco, and I’ve been there for a few days last year, and I really felt that it’s the place to be… maybe I would do that. To exchange, learn and who knows, do some business. (Laughs)



 </p>



<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  This is easy!! This is an easy one!! (Laughs) I would say number one would be Italy, because I have Italian family, Italian origins. And… so I feel that in my home culture, we have a lot of Italian culture, so I feel close to Italy. And, if I could add another one, it would be…I’ve been to Egypt last year and I have Lebanese family, so I really felt comfortable in their culture also, so I think it’s all about my roots. (Laughs) Yeah. It’s…I’ve never been to Lebanon, and I don’t think it’s a good time to go, but…
<br><br>
>>>Yeah maybe not the best time to go…
<br><br>
Yeah. I think the culture. You know, I feel comfortable in both Lebanese and Italian culture. I don’t know if this is a mess, what I’m saying, but it feels right.(Laughs)

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
You know. I would say… a really casual bar…  not fancy at all, what we call a boteco. Just in the street, you know, like where almost the street and the bar mixed up. People are standing up. So that’s what Rio is for me. It’s where you can discuss about anything in a very informal way and just, have some fun with people you like.
<br><br>
>>>Would you consider that both a place and a thing, a bar ? Because its  also a  place, and it is a thing.
<br><br>
Yeah, you know, I tried to choose something really iconic, but not like what anyone would say, like the beach. The beach is really carioca because it’s democratic, and it’s… it’s this (points to the beach). But that you already know, so I talked about the bar because it’s what we really do in our regular basis and represents us, our casual way of being. We can talk about business in a bar, or about very intimate stuff, and that’s the way it is. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Yeah. So! Well… (Thinking)… I think I would do a flag that you could read… that you could see right from both sides. ’Cause our flag has (Laughs)  a technical issue. In the middle we have the circle with a wide bend, and the bend is like this (diagonal). So when you see the flag against the sun, the other side makes a shadow, and it turns into an “X.” (Leo bursts into laughter) I don’t like that. It’s also an aesthetic thing.
<br><br>
>>>Wow!  Great. I’ve never heard that before. So you want it to be symmetrical.
<br><br>
That works either way, you know. A flag is supposed to be balanced!  
<br><br>
>>> Wait…so they actually have two different prints on each side ?
<br><br>
Yeah. They have one print here and another one there. Also, because of the writing. 
<br><br>
>>>I see. It’s because from the other side the writing would be from the opposite, so they have to have had the writing from the same side on each side. Interesting!
<br><br>
Yeah, and what I don’t like about it is when you see it against the sun, it’s… it’s really an X in the middle of the flag, so it doesn’t look nice. I don’t like that. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow ! That’s really cool. I’d never heard of that.
<br><br>
Yeah. But otherwise I love our flag. I love the colors. I think it’s a really good symbol for Brazilians. Yeah.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
You know it’s kind of easy to answer with an image. The ocean for me. It’s… something that is really important. I’ve lived in, in Paris for almost a year—
<br><br>
>>>So you lied to us!  
<br><br>
—and I really missed the ocean. 
<br><br>
>>>You lied to us! (laughs)
<br><br>
Born and raised!
<br><br>
>>>Born and raised, but you spent a year away?
<br><br>
Ah, it’s just a little bit. (Laughs)  So, I really missed the ocean. The ocean is, like home to me, you know. It‘s where I feel at home. And, if I could choose an image for the ocean, it would be, like the sand, and the ocean, and the horizon, and the blue sky.
<br><br>
>>>You didn’t even have to say that. Your image is home. That’s a better answer. (laughs) 
<br><br>
Okay! Perfect! 
<br><br>


—The Sun <br>
Speaker 1: Ah ! The sun! It’s… oh it’s energy, you know. It’s where you recharge. It’s a “must.”  (Laughs)  I don’t know. I don’t know how to live without the sun. For example, if I were to live in London, like, the gray city, I would be sad. So for me, maybe sun is happiness. 
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Speaker 1: Death. Death is gonna’ happen, you know?  It’s something that scares us.  But it’s also what makes us… do good things. It‘s like, you need to do it now ’cause you could die at any minute. So maybe it’s a driver… 
<br><br>

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
For the future? I’m very optimistic. So, I think of a good future. But… for Brazil, the present is not really cheering me up. The present is not that good. But, I think we’re going to have a good future, but we need a lot more time to build it, you know? We need to pass through a lot of challenges in order to, build our citizenship and make a good Brazil. But I believe we’re going to get better as we have been getting better, even with all the issues. And, I think that, for Brazil, a very good thing is the cultural exchange we’re starting to have more now. People are coming here from other countries. They’re teaching us a lot of their culture. And, we’re teaching them. I guess this is something that will help us build a better country. For myself, right now, I think it’s going to be hard to get a very good future here… I think it’s not easy for anyone, especially here in Brazil, but… you know, I like what I do. I like my life. I like to work hard. So, I think it’s gonna’ come. I like the present. 
<br><br>
Okay. For the humanity, I also think we’re heading to a much better place. Sometimes people get very scared about some things. And, they always see the bad things, but I see a good world, a world that is getting better on the overall. I don’t watch so much TV, so I think I don’t get so affected by the bad stories. I think that with technology, things are becoming more abundant. So, I see a great future for us all.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
No. No ! The most important thing for anyone is health, I think. It’s what you need in order to get all the rest. (Laughs) You need to be healthy. You need to be capable of doing things.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 What I look for in a partner is someone… that really is a “partner,” you know?  That really is there when you need it. That you can count on and you can talk about anything. And it’s really someone you trust and build your life together with. Someone that… sticks… that passes through everything with you. Not only a good company to go to the movies or a restaurant. That is easy to find, but someone that is really caring about you and your family, and building, and…  passing through all the problems together, and really building a stronger relationship.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yes. Yes, I do.<br>
Children: Oh yes. (Laughs) If I have the money, I’d want to have like 3 or 4. Huge family! I like big families.<br><br>

So what I want to do with my children? Ah, I want to play with them. I want to raise them in a place where we can have a bit of nature to ourselves. Hmmm… I would rather a house than an apartment, but that‘s kind of hard to afford. I would travel with them. I would bring them outside, I would play with them. I think I would really like having them.

</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 THIS!!! Yeah!!! This is what I already choose to do every morning, almost every morning. So, I think this was an easy one because I already made this decision, so I come here…
<br><br>
>>>Wow ! So you’re living the ideal. Wow!
<br><br>
Yeah. I like this. I like to see the nature. It’s important for me to see the sun, to see people, to see the nature. I get my energy from that.
<br><br>
>>>What about before you go to sleep ?
<br><br>
Oh before I go to sleep, I think I’m going for the cliché here, but the night sky, you know? If I could sleep watching the sky, with the stars, I would love that. It’s just so beautiful! I like nature, so I think maybe in the beginning and the end of the day, you should get connected to it. We all are, but just be remembered of that…

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 Happiest moment in my entire life? I would have to say when my niece was born, my first niece. Yeah. It was pretty happy. You know, huge excitement. It was just a simple feeling of true happiness. It was really happy. 
<br><br>
>>>How long ago was that?
<br><br>
I think 4 years ago? 
<br><br>
>>>Your older brother or sister?
<br><br>
My older sister, and then my other sister had two other children, so now I’m an aunt of three.
<br><br>
>>>What about the most terrifying moment?
<br><br>
Oh, the most terrifying moment was when I moved to another country with another language, all by myself, where I didn’t know anybody, to work in a different culture and a different company.
<br><br>
>>>Was that Paris? Where was it ?
<br><br>
Yeah. That was Paris. I was 21, and I had just graduated. I was going to work full-time in this French company with French people speaking French, living in a city where I didn’t know anyone. Oh, and it was winter, it was fucking cold!! No one was out in the streets, so I was really scared of that in the beginning. But it all went pretty well. So, I would do it again.
<br><br>
>>>Wow! What kind of job were you in?
<br><br>
I was a branding assistant at Carrefour Group. I graduated as a designer and went there to work with branding and packaging. It was pretty nice. A great opportunity.
<br><br>
>>>What made you go all the way to France? Were you looking for that job?
<br><br>
A teacher of mine told me about the selection process for this job. It was a once-in-a -lifetime opportunity, really, for a recent graduated designer to have an international experience in the field that I had chosen to work with. I just had to apply and go.
<br><br>
>>>Do you speak French now?
<br><br>
Yeah. 



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
(Laughs) My childhood dream was to be a veterinarian? How do you I say that?
<br><br>
>>>Veterinarian. Yeah.
<br><br>
Veterinarian. Yeah. So it was to be a veterinarian and have a bunch of puppies around me. (Laughs) I don’t know. It was not like, a huge dream. Now my dream is, you know, to spend some time abroad to achieve professional goals and fulfil my challenges and build a family and be happy. I don’t know, I’m just living… the present. I want to achieve many things. I have my personal goals and some, challenges that I need to go through, but… I think having a happy life now and always. This is my dream.
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell the child you now?
<br><br>
I would tell her, or me, just… work hard.  Don’t think about what other people are thinking of you. Don’t care about that. Just do your thing. Do it the way you think it should be done, and you’re going to be good. Don’t worry. Just focus. Focus on what you want. Don’t care about others.
