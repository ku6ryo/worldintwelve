    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：30　Years in Rio de Janeiro： 2<br>
     <br>  
    Lily was introduced to me through Pedro. Lily is one of those people that you would define with a bunch or “e” adjectives—eccentric, electrifying, full or energy and enjoying life to the fullest. She has done her world travelling, she has worked in various fields I have never even imagined existed, and most of all, she is all over the place! I met Lily a few times while in Rio, mostly with Roberta and Pedro (as you can see in the pictures), but I had to consider myself lucky. If there was anytime off, whether it be afterwork on a weekday, or a long weekend, Lily was out, everywhere! Even while I was there, Lily did an early morning hike to the outskirts or Rio (as you can see in pic.1), and took a trip to the centre of Brazil to check out a famous lagoon (as you can see in pics. 4,5). So yeah, basically talking and being with Lily makes you think “Holy…I got to get my shit together“ in the best way possible :). All of Lily’s answers are great, but if I were to choose, I’d say closeness (Q.2), future (Q.6),  children (Q.9), and moments (Q.11). So Lily, thanks again, and I will see you around! You’ll be travelling again I’m sure, and we’ll meet up!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    We’re in Copacabana. And though it’s a touristic area, this square is kind of a local area. Where people…well it’s great for happy hours. A few people live here.  A few people work here. So it’s kind of a meeting spot. And I think although we’re in the most touristic neighborhood,  I actually find it less touristic than having a drink in Ipanema. I find this more local than actually having a drink there. So that’s a good thing. This is a place I come with friends and all.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  Okay, this will be the hardest [Note: Leo shows the list of questions right before the interview]. I think this is gonna be the hardest question but I think I have the answer. So…if it was a few years ago, I would definitely choose super large cities like London. Or I’ve been in London before but that’s a place I really wanted to live. Or even New York. But I’ve been to both places in the past five years or so and…well I did live in London, so that’s off [the list]. So I started thinking about a place that would be more of a deeper experience than just a metropolis that’s kind of a similar experience to Sao Paolo. If you’re in New York, you’re in Hong Kong. I start to feel like they’re all the same.  It had to be something deeper. So I’m thinking Cuzco. I’d live in Cuzco for a month. 
<br><br>
>>>In Peru? 
<br><br>
Yeah, in Peru, and I’ll tell you why. So I wanted a place to actually do something with more of a routine. Not just live there… and it could be a place I could study the language and also get involved in the culture, food, lifestyle. And it’s a very, sanctuary place and I think I would get very much involved in the town and people. And it’s still a very charming town that you can explore. Not just like a trip you do, a backpack trip you do in South America. But a place I could actually be a local and explore a lot of the culture. I think that would be it. I might do that very soon.
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 All right…(Thinking)…well when I was traveling for a while, and I started to feel a bit homesick, I think the place I was more comfortable was… Well there are a few places actually and they’re all related to Brazil, that’s quite obvious. But I’ve been to Mozambique. And after that I was in Portugal. A few months after I was in Portugal. And obviously it has a lot to do with the Portuguese colonization. And it was so crazy in Mozambique how it absolutely felt like home. All the chaos. Kind of dishonest and we call it (Portuguese for dihonesty?). It felt like that and it felt good actually. I felt comfortable with that. People are always smiling and it’s all about food, partying, and people are very lively. And so I felt really comfortable there. And though it’s chaos and it’s not an absolute safe place to be, there are lively people so I did feel a bit at home there.
<br><br>
And as for Portugal, it’s not like home. It doesn’t feel like home. But it kind of made me understand a lot about how I feel about Brazil and how I feel about home. So those are two places, a bit obvious. But Mozambique looks like 100 years behind Brazil, and Portugal should be what Brazil should head toward, though it’s not like that. But being in both places explained a lot about why I like home even though it’s a big mixture, and not always in a good way.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I think it’s  more like a way than a thing but I love how you can always leave for the beach or—more than that. You can leave your place at 8 am and you have your flip flops and you’re wearing your bikinis and you go all day wearing the same thing. At the end of the day, you just go inside a restaurant wearing your flip flops and bikinis and from the most fancy place to the most sketchy one, you’re there. That’s very Carioca style. I absolutely love it. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there a place or is it the beach? 
<br><br>
 The beach is quite obvious. Though I love it. 
<br><br>
>>>You could just leave it at the thing. The thing is good enough.
<br><br>
Yeah, I think that’s more, because you can either be riding a bike and stop by and have a juice somewhere or you could have been at the beach and just go to a restaurant. I think it’s more about the movement and being everywhere. Like, in the same day, you did some hiking and you went to the beach and after that, you went to a fancy restaurant. All in the same day. And you don’t have to dress up or anything, and I love that. So I love that movement and how free you are.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
I don’t think I would. Some people might say it’s a bit too tropical and that’s part of how foreign people associate Brazil. Just, “we live in a jungle and there are monkeys everywhere.” (Leo laughs)  But I actually find it very authentic. Brazil is that beautiful mixture between nature and people and how warm it is because of all that. So it is a tropical country anyway. So I’m happy with it. I wouldn’t change it.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Okay…(thinking)… Can I say feelings? Yeah, yeah? Okay. So…(thinking)… I’m absolutely terrified about it, scared at the same time that I’m absolutely amazed by it. And it’s somewhat like how I feel about life. 
<br><br>
>>> Oh. The ocean is a life metaphor! Oohh!
<br><br>
Yeah. I’m not getting too deep and philosophical about it but, yeah (Leo laughs). Something like that. You never know what’s coming and it can be sketchy and it can be amazing and surprising. And I’m thinking more about the underwater life. Something like that. It’s never been truly covered and people, there’s still a lot of things to get to know. So yeah, I think that would be it.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
The sun? Wow. Wow. I think that’s happiness. Absolute happiness. I’m moved by…me and probably 90% of the Cariocas and Brazilians, I’d say. We’re activated by the sun. Sun is life. We couldn’t do anything without life and it absolutely has everything to do with humor [having fun].
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 Death? Um… (thinking)… That’s a hard one. (Thinking)… Well, I’d say I’m not scared about death when it comes to me, but I’m absolutely scared about people around me dying. First of all, I don’t see myself dying. I don’t see death close, so I’m not scared about it but it’s more related to attachment to other people. So I would say that’s something. Like I feel too attached to death more than I should when it comes to other people.
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 I would be concerned about the future...I could say all of mankind. I think that’s the point I’m more scared about. I’m more skeptical about it.  But it has a lot to do with me as well. I wonder where our generation is headed. And especially the new, the earlier, more of the newborn generations. It’s very provocative how sometimes I see a lot of changes coming while on the other hand, I think we’re going on a path that I don’t know how—I’m not confident it’s a sustainable path. And that has totally to do with—I could say mankind—but it has a lot to do with me. So how you deal with work, career, and how you deal with your time and how many hours you’re connected and how relationships have changed. 
<br><br>
 I’ve been through things that made me see how important it is for you to disconnect and disattach from a steady and safe life. And still, when you’re back, it’s so hard to let go. So it is all about the same thing in the end. Like, it’s all how you’re not living the relationships as you should. You’re not having as much free time as you should. And it’s the same personal drama that I see for mankind. If we’re truly connected to one another nature-wise…like you do when you’re traveling. When I was traveling, I was absolutely safe of what I was doing and where I was going. I said “this is what I should do for my life and this is what mankind should do”. They should be interacting with other people, to respect the difference in culture. They should be admiring nature and everything because that will make them more respectful and more sustainable. 
<br><br>
So when we’re doing what you’re doing [Note: in this case travelling], you’re living the life to say “okay, I’m doing the right thing here”. But when you’re back to your life and routine and career that you start working to maintain a lifestyle and you question this lifestyle and it’s all wrong. And you don’t have a relationship like you should. You’re not so cautious as you should be, and this kind of thing. So I think those are my worries about the future. It’s mankind and it’s who I am. Species.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lily/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Thing for me? I’d say “freedom” for sure. Yeah. Absolutely. In all senses. Like, relationship, career, time-wise. I would say freedom. Yeah. Family. Like that’s something I still need. I needed it when I was two years old and I need when I’m 30.  And I’ll probably need it when I’m 70. Even if I’m married, and have kids, and grandkids. This is still something I still need. Freedom of choice, freedom of space, freedom of relationships.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
In a partner? Wow…. (thinking)…definitely someone with a background that has lived and has done things that is able to share with me. That’s something for sure. I always like to be with someone that is always teaching me and sharing things that I’m interested in and don’t know yet. Someone I can stay long nights talking to and we won’t run out of subject or regular talk. So that’s something important, and I think I value a lot of intelligence. I like to be with someone more intelligent than I am. So I think that’s it. And someone who likes to travel. That’s an important one. I couldn’t bear—I’ve been with people that I was absolutely crazy about but didn’t have any intention of leaving for a weekend.  I’m always flying on the weekend. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>That’s the thing about Lily here. She always has somewhere to go.
<br><br>
Exactly. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lily/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: I think I do. I think I’m at a time where I want a partner. I kind of need a partner. Even for my travelings.  I did this trip on my own. It was fantastic. Though I couldn’t remain that long by myself, but this time, I’m ready to drop everything and travel but I don’t want to do it by myself anymore. So I think I’m at the stage I need to build something with someone. So yes. But marriage is a strong word. I need company. I need someone to be with. It doesn’t have to be like forever but I’d love a relationship at this stage. So yes.
<br><br>
Children: For sure. I’m more excited about children than I am about marriage. I’m definitely having kids. I don’t know how, but I am for sure. But getting married, I don’t know. I’m definitely going to be someone that goes in and out of relationships. Maybe stays in one… but marriage is a strong word.
<br><br>
Actually, there is. I told Pedro all that the other day. So when I was a kid, I lived in Wales for two years. My dad had his station there and that made up a lot of who I am right now. More than the travels I did as a grown-up. Because when you’re educating a child and you want her to open her eyes and her mind about life and people and cultures, it’s a very special time to do that. So I lived things that none of my friends in Brazil lived—they just lived [in their hometown] until they were 15 or 20. When they had already built some ideas. But for me it was a bit different. It was kind of rare back then to travel and live abroad like that. So it was a very special thing for me. Now it’s quite common but it’s still something I want to do. More than to travel for myself, to get my children to travel and to experience new lifestyles. 
<br><br>
And there’s one thing I’m very critical about Brazil. Its this kind of new style slavery way. We all have housekeepers and manual labor.  Yeah, it’s so cheap in Brazil. You never do anything with your bare hands. You have someone to fix your shoes or wash your car or stay at the elevator, pressing a bus. Brazil is, in a very bad way, used to that and I hate that. I love how in Europe or even in America, they’re more independent in that way.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I think that too. Like walking down the street here you have people shine your shoes for you, you come home and have people clean your house for you. 
<br><br>
Exactly. And that’s so normal for Brazil that we never...we’ve been so used to having people doing everything but we kind of still live like the royal people used to live here. And I think that’s pathetic.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, it has directly to do with the class system still implemented in Brazil, huh. 
<br><br>
Exactly, exactly.  We’re all used to that. That was something, an important lesson when I lived abroad. And I really take that as an example. Like we all look up to American and Europe but nobody wants to live like that, deep inside. And that’s a lesson I learned and that’s something I try to adapt. I still have a house cleaner but it’s something I wanna get more and more independent from. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Well I love music when I wake up. And I love the sun and nature. So for me to have a happy day, it’s definitely just to get my bike and head to Flamengo. Flamengo’s a park where you can see the Guanabara Bay. But this interaction where… you start the day with nature and remember that you live in Rio. …You should try the dried meat once here, it’s so good. 
<br><br>
[Note: Here Lily and Leo talk to waiter about which Pastel to get next]
<br><br>
So… I would start with just remember you live in Rio and that’s my thing. Going out, the outdoors and music. Sometimes it’s 6 am and I wanna turn on the music. It gets me really lively. And before I sleep, I don’t have that much preference. I’m always really tired and there’s no big routine. 
<br><br>
>>>Ideally. What do you want to see?
<br><br>
Well ideally, I would have a nice, relaxed shower. And I don’t do that every night so I always sleep better if I have this perfect routine before I go to bed. Put my creams on and things I never do, but that would be ideal. Have a long shower but I never do that. I’m always pretty tired. Have a quick shower and go to bed.

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lily/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 That’s so hard. Well definitely traveling, that’s no doubt. But it’s hard to point one moment. (Thinking)…I always say that a happy trip, like a perfect trip, it’s not like the entire trip was perfect. The whole thing, but those ten minutes you have or even ten seconds that you have—this breeze come in. Or this scene or this moment that makes you feel absolutely grateful for your existence. That’s worth your entire trip. And in my one year trip, I probably have ten moments of those but it makes the whole thing worth it.
<br><br>
>>>I relate to that very much. 
<br><br>
Isn’t it? It’s not like every moment you’re absolutely happy in a place. That’s never true. Every place I’ve been to, even if it’s absolutely special, it’s not like you’re happy 100 percent of the time. If there’s even one moment that will make you remember this place, you’re gonna remember “I was happy there. I was happy at that trip”. And I had plenty of those moments and I can name a few. I can never say one place. I think the place I was closest to for a long period I was really happy—Southeast Asia had some things. Because it has the whole thing. It’s a cultural experience. You’re actually very close to locals so you’re not feeling very arrogant about anything. You feel like you actually have your feet on the ground there and at the same time it’s not… Well you have nature everywhere. You feel very happy about yourself. It’s crazy. 
<br><br>
There was one second that I remember saying “okay, my entire existence is to be here in this place” - having this feeling. And I was crossing the Mekong River for two days and in one of those moments, there was this special light and all these people in the boat were absolutely connected and I was so happy and thankful. And that’s one thing. The place that I pray the most and I’m very grateful, is always when I’m traveling and I have this very majestic experience. So I was telling you about my trip to [Lagoon area in central Brazil] and I have these two moments there that probably last less than one minute and I say okay, “I’ll remember feeling that happy every time I remember that place.” So there are a number of situations on a list of countries and places I felt like that. But definitely related to travel. 
<br><br>
>>>What was terrifying?
<br><br>
(Thinking)…I think…(thinking)…I don’t know how to explain it in English but I think it’s kind of a human despair. When you feel very suffocated. Kind of a panic attack. I never had something that I could actually qualify as that but it’s always related when you’re very suffocated about travel, about work, and about money and how that’s so big in your life. And I have moments like that. Before I travel, after I travel, and every time that that happens. And I’m so scared. It’s not about death or losing someone. It’s just about…I’m not in my most balanced moment here and that’s absolutely terrifying. It’s not about violence or even life risk when you’re traveling and you have something really scary happen. None of that. But being in a place where you’re absolutely scared and you can’t live with yourself. That’s the most terrifying thing. And when I get there, I say “okay, you have to stop whatever you’re doing and get out of this situation. This is not healthy.” And I’d say I’m very centered to this… just okay, stop whatever you’re doing and get out of here. But I’ve been there so I would say that. 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
(Thinking)… Well it’s kind of childish, what I’d say. But I always had this dream related to the sciences and research to try and change some small things, but not so much to change the world. “Find the cure for this or that”---nothing like that but… be someone that was really into researching and finding out things. To be someone that discovered things. And I’m definitely not that. Not in the scientific field. Definitely not. I’m absolutely not an academic person in anything. But I think that was my child image of what I would be in the future. Which was never having a house and a family. It was never that since I was a kid.  If I can remember one dream, I would say that. And I remember a lot of fields. At certain age, I thought I would be in astronomy and then just a scientist like with large glasses and things. (Leo laughs) Definitely not me.  
<br><br>
>>> What would you tell little Lily?
<br><br>
What I would tell her? (Thinking) I would definitely advise her to continue searching and experiencing things. It was something I already had when I was a child. Exploring and living. I was very—my parents say that since I was a baby, I used to question them a lot. Why this and why that? I think I had the motivation to do that. My parents, they let me do that a lot. So I would just say keep looking for it. Keep searching. Keep questioning and that was something I did. And at certain stages, I could not realize and be critical anymore, but I could always go back and get back on track. 
<br><br>
So my dream today? Well it’s very self-centered or arrogant, selfish in a way. And I think Rio gave me a lot of that. I really want a balanced routine and a balanced life. And that’s not something I have. And I’m always up and downs in life and I’m always busy. And I never have a routine but if I could choose something, it’s to have a nice and healthy routine and a nice lifestyle and just live the moment here in Rio. And continue having these perfect mornings and find people that are into that. Find a job that actually provides you this freedom and balance at the same time. Find a partner that has the same ambitions as I do in this sense. So I think that’s it. I want a happy life in Rio and I have it so far. With ups and downs but when I look at the big picture, I’d say Rio was the place I’ve been more—yeah at the same time down to earth and I have changes of routines. But it’s a place where I’ve been more balanced.
<br><br>
I think I’m living my dream. I’m good with it. It’s no longer traveling the world. I did that. And during my life, I’m still gonna do a lot of this kind of traveling.  Maybe shorter, maybe longer. Maybe I’m gonna live at a place. Maybe with company. Maybe with a partner, maybe with kids. But it’s something that’s already a part of my life so I’m gonna do that. Probably another five, ten times in different ways but I’m gonna do it. So I’m comfortable with that dream. Not the biggest dream. That’s it. Chau!
