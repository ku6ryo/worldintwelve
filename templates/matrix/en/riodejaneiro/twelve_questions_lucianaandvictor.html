    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    【Age】 Luciana：28 Victor：28　【Years in Rio de Janeiro】 Luciana：10  Victor：28 (Eggyolk Carioca!) <br>
     <br>  

Luciana and Victor were introduced to me through Pedro, and the first time I met them was at Luciana’s birthday party. It was one of those parties I’ll remember for a long time; I ate the best home made feijoada known to man, and enough brigadeiro to last me a year. Also, I got to meet so many cool people, as seen on previous 12 Qs. 
<br><br>
Both Luciana and Victor are designers, and not graphic, on-the-computer designers, but actual product designers. They have their own line called Bolei (you can check out their home page below), and really, their creations are absolutely epic. There is a strong message behind each one, usually revolving around some sort of environmental sustainability and recycling, and the imagination and creativity I witnessed was just off the charts. Victor even gave me one of their  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boleidesign.com/manera">“wallets” / money cips</a>, made from scraps used to create surf boards--of course, all environmentally friendly. Wow. That’s all I can say. 
<br><br>  
As you can imagine, both Luciana and Victor gave great answers. Reading each one is ideal, but if you’re pressed for time, choose the flag (Q.4), the thing (Q.7), the moments (Q.11), and the dreams (Q.12). So Luciana and Victor, we will definitely meet again! I know your products will appear in Tokyo Design Week, so you have to make it over!! 
   <br><br>

    ---Check out Victor and Luciana's design product line at: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boleidesign.com/">www.boleidesign.com</a>. It's so amazingly cool, you have to take a look!!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
  Place: Victor: This is our apartment and we also work here. We actually just moved. So it’s still a work in progress. 
<br><br>
>>>I like it very much!! 

  </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lucianaandvictor/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  Victor: Because it’s more sunny. (laughs) I like that vibe right now. I want to go to a place that has a beach, and I can relax. If it’s vacation, I want to relax. I’ve been to all three, but Barcelona is the most easy-going of them. 
<br><br>
>>>Luciana??
<br><br>
Luciana: I don’t know…I’d like to go to place I can stay with my family and friends. I don’t know…(Thinking)…I don’t know! With what was it…6000 reals? I think I’d go to another Brazilian place. A place in Brazil. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow, interesting. 
<br><br>
Luciana: (Speaks in Portuguese to Victor) Aha, Bonito. I’d go to Bonito, it’s a pretty city in Brazil. It’s very beautiful!! And very expensive. 
<br><br>
>>>Is it a beach city?? 
<br><br>
Victor: No no! It’s in Pantanal, a village in the woods! They have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=bonito+brasil&espv=2&biw=1424&bih=778&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CBgQsARqFQoTCOy9ya2d_8gCFSOBcgodh0IMqw&dpr=1#imgrc=LiDGLY3y4O2EEM%3A">very beautiful lake</a>…it’s been a place on our “to go” list. 
<br><br>
Luciana: And it’s a place we have to think about before going because it’s so expensive to go there. So that would be nice. Bonito with my friends. 


 </p>



<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Victor: I think…the closest for me is actually Italy. I’ve always liked it there, their culture and everything. The history too. My grandfather’s mom…yeah, she was Italian, and my grandfather was raised with a huge Italian influence. And he passed it on all the way to me. So it’s a place that I not only find myself close to the culture, but the habits, the food…and I think it’s similar to Brazil in many aspects. I find myself there a lot, and it’s the country I identify with the most. 
<br><br>
Luciana: For me too, Italy! 
<br><br>
>>>Oh! Boyfriend influence!! 
<br><br>
Luciana: No no no! I swear!! (Everybody laughs). Because…I stayed there twice, three times? And because I like the streets…(asks a word in Portuguese to Victor)…yeah the environment, the mood. The people.  
<br><br>
Victor: I think it’s because you feel at home, but at the same time it’s very different. In Greece I felt it also, this warm feeling, but it’s a Mediterranean thing. And we were colonized by the Portuguese, who are also Mediterranean. We identify with that. We have huge beaches too. So I think it’s really similar, but I couldn’t read anything that was written there (laughs). So that was hard. We actually took Italian courses together. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s awesome. 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah, I love Italian culture. 



</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lucianaandvictor/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 Victor: For me, I’d go with the cliché. I think they are the most representative. I think its the beach. The think…(Thinking)…I thing the thing is…maybe the slums?? Because of the contrast. They are normally in a beautiful place. It makes “the mix” in Rio, which is also another aspect of Rio, other than its natural beauty. I think it’s…other than its natural beauty, which is awesome, it [the slums] is part of the city. You have the contrast, the people living with each other, this kind of beautiful mess. The favelas. It’s what makes Rio, Rio. 
<br><br>
>>>Very cool.   
<br><br>
Luciana: I don’t know about the thing, but the place is the beach. Of course, the beach!
<br><br>
Victor: The first thing I thought of was the mate tea of the beach (laughs).
<br><br>
>>>The mate tea! Amazing (laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah, mate. And <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=globo+brazil+biscuit&espv=2&biw=1424&bih=778&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI0u_Bm57_yAIVhodyCh0-jw5b">Globo</a>!! [The biscuit/doughnuts] 

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
Victor: I think I wouldn’t. I really like the flag. I think it represents Brazil a lot, and also is well represented. It’s constructed well around the concepts [of Brazil]. Our country isn’t really fulfilling what’s said on the flag, but…(Everybody mixes between a sigh and a sad chuckle)…it’s one of the few flags which has writing on it, and it says “Order and Progress.” But…yeah. I think it’s a goal (everyone laughs). You gotta get there. I like the “goal.” 
<br><br>
Luciana: I like the colors of the flag. The green is the forest. The yellow is the riches, the gold. The blue is the ocean. I like these colors to represent our country. But I don’t like this phrase. “Order and Progress.”
<br><br>
>>>So you guys are going at each other for the first time (laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: Because we don’t have either. Order, nor progress. Well, a little progress. (Leo laughs). Maybe something like “Love another like you love yourself.” That would be better!!! (Everybody laughs)
<br><br>
>>>So a different message!!
<br><br>
Luciana: YES!!!
<br><br>
Victor: (Laughs) “Know who you are”, and then make a new message! She’s right, “order” is the farthest thing from Brazil at this point…(laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: But I guess it’s relative…some progress has gotten us this far.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean <br>
Luciana: For me it is blue…and calm. Calmness. Blue and green, like this. [points]
<br><br>
>>>Like your wall! (laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: Yes. 
<br><br>
Victor: For me, the ocean reminds me of the beach, and the waves. And also…I would’t say “calm,” but this relaxing feeling. Easy-going. And there is the connection with nature, which is instantly made. Water just has that aspect that makes you relaxed. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
<br><br>
Victor: I’m thinking heat. It’s very hot. 
<br><br>
Luciana: For me it’s “hugging”!! Because…when its a little bit cold--like today I feel its a little cold--it makes me feel warm. Like hugging. 
<br><br>
Victor: It’s because she’s from Nova Friburgo which is north of Rio, in the mountains. 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah it’s really cold!! The sun is necessary to make you warm.
<br><br>
>>>Wow, so the sun is a giant being that hugs you with warmness!! Cool. So Victor, when you say “heat” do you mean how the sun creates a hot day, or the heat that’s directly on you from the sun?? 
<br><br>
Victor: Well, both, but mainly the hotness of the day. Because when I think of the sun, I think of a hot sunny day, where you’re sweating, and you’re just physically hot. It’s not bad…but it’s hot. 
<br><br>
>>>So I see, not a cool sunny day. That just doesn’t happen in Rio haha.
<br><br>
—Death <br>
<br><br>
Luciana: I don’t know. 
<br><br>
Victor: Death is hard…I don’t think I think of anything. I think it may be just “it.” That’s it. Like a new formation, or transformation. For me, death is a void. 
<br><br>
>>>A void. That’s a good word. 
<br><br>
Luciana: For me, it’s white. I don’t know why. [Speaks in portuguese] Yeah, whenever people talk about death, or someone’s death, that’s what I imagine. Whiteness. I don’t know why. Also..[speaks in Portuguese to Victor]
<br><br>
Victor: The reaper?
<br><br>
Luciana: Yes! In Portuguese, Death has the image of the reaper, so I have that image too. 
<br><br>
>>>I get Grim Reaper a lot, but not white…
<br><br>
Luciana: The white, it is sort of a “peace.”
<br><br>
>>>Aha, like into the white light! 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Victor: For me it’s hope. Because the only thing that makes us going…(Luciana takes a deep breath)…well, actually hope tied with faith. For me faith is something much bigger than just religion, which is what most people tie faith to. It’s believing. You have to believe in the future. And that’s where hope comes in. You have to have hope for the future, for something better, or you’ll go crazy! And it just makes you feel better, which is important. 
<br><br>
Luciana: For me it’s faith too. (Laughs) When Victor said hope, I thought of faith (laughs). Faith because, at the core, Brazil is a religious country. It doesn’t matter what religion you are, but you have faith. And with that faith, we can finally make a change…(laughs)


</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lucianaandvictor/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Victor: For me, it’s life.
<br><br>
>>>Life. What do you mean by “life”?
<br><br>
Victor: What I mean is, for you, for any living thing, even for other things, life is the most important. The living spirit. That is the most beautiful thing. Everything is alive for me. Even the ocean. That’s why I work so much with sustainability. It’s the most important thing. You have to preserve it. You have to keep the drive, keep on passing it forward. I think life has these aspects—the preservation, the endurance, the resistance, the evolution—it’s all about “life”. Everything can, in essence, be reduced to “life”. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow…(Victor laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: For me it’s people. 
<br><br>
>>>People…just in general? 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yes! I just love people!! It’s the most important thing. 
<br><br>
Victor: She is very much a people person. 
<br><br>
Luciana: I like nature…yeah, nature is important for me too. But I like people. My family and friends of course, but all people. People in general! 
<br><br>
Victor: Yeah, it’s similar to me too. That’s why I said life! 
<br><br>
>>>Wow we have two very Buddha-like people in front of me here…one loves all life, and the other loves all people! (Everyone laughs)



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
(After Leo asks the question, everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: A person who likes life!! (laughs) 
<br><br>
Victor: Well, for me it’s…love, obviously but…(thinking)…it’s something that Luciana made me realize before I started dating her, and it’s honesty. Do your actions speak of who you are? This is really important to me, because this is something I try to be. To always try to be better, respect others, be sincere, be honest. These are things that I like, and I get that from her. Even though we have our differences—
<br><br>
Luciana: MANY differences!! 
<br><br>
Victor:—we have our troubles, but  honesty is what ties us together. Because that is the trust factor. It’s what makes our relationship real. 
<br><br>
Luciana: For me it’s the same!! (Laughs)
<br><br>
Victor: I can leave the room if you want. (Everyone laughs)
<br><br>
Luciana: No no!  [Speaks in Portuguese to Victor] It’s just hard…there are many things. So many things, it’s hard to choose one to talk about. I think honesty is very, VERY, important because I had other relationships that…well…ugh. Blech. (Everybody laughs). It’s what leads to love. Real love, honest love. Where you can talk about anything. Respect the other the way they are.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lucianaandvictor/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
[Marriage]<br>
Luciana: Yeah, live together. I like, I like…I like people! (Both Leo and Victor laugh) Yeah, I like people, and I like to make parties. And I think it’s very important to celebrate love with the people you love. Not the traditional celebration with a dress and everything—whatever. Only celebrate the love. And not at the beginning…I don’t know, when I feel it’s right. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow cool. And we’re skipping Victor’s opinion (laughs)
<br><br>
Victor: Yeah I’m with her. (laughs)
<br><br>
[Children] Both answer yes. 
<br><br>
Victor: I don’t know if it’s strange, but I’ve always thought of having kids, having a son. And I would love to give him knowledge…no not really knowledge, but pass on what I’ve learned. So he can become a better person, the best he can be. Not like me. A lot of people…how can I put it…put their frustrations on their kids. I wouldn’t do that. I’d like to get to know him, and try to make him a better person. 
<br><br>
Luciana: Him, or her. (laughs)
<br><br>
Victor: Of course. Sorry (laughs). But yeah to help that person become the best person he or she can be! 
<br><br>
Luciana: I think the most important lesson is “To love another like you love yourself.”
<br><br>
Victor: Do to others what you would like them to do to you. 
<br><br>
Luciana: I think it’s a biblical phrase. I think it’s very important, because when you love the other person, it’s better for the world. If everybody can think that way, the world would be a better place. 
<br><br>
>>> Treat others as you’d like to be treated. It’s in every religion, believe it or not…


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Luciana: Him!! (laughs, points at Victor)
<br><br>
>>>Yay!!! Is that for both waking up and going to bed?? 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah…morning I guess. Because at night I sleep first. 
<br><br>
Victor: She sleeps everywhere and anywhere. She loves to sleep. 
<br><br>
>>>Are you feeling any pressure?? 
<br><br>
Victor: No! (Laughs) Me too, I believe that too. I like to wake up and…not necessarily see her, but know that she’s there. That’s it. And sleep, for me, is really hard. So I don’t know. 
<br><br>
>>>Why is it hard?? 
<br><br>
Victor: I don’t know…I like to do things. Read…to stop everything and sleep…I only go to sleep when I’m exhausted. When I want to sleep, I really WANT to sleep. I don’t want to do anything else. I just want to get to bed and wake up. That’s all. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow that’s really interesting. So I guess for you, it would be to know that you’ve done everything! 
<br><br>
Victor: Yeah! That’s it.  


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/lucianaandvictor/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Victor: That’s hard…
<br><br>
Luciana: The worst for me was…[Speaks in Portuguese to Victor]…
<br><br>
Victor: She’s saying…well here in Rio there are a lot of “thieves” or criminals who come and rob you. On the beach or in traffic…it’s where they just go rob everyone in a row. It’s called…
<br><br>
Luciana: It’s terrible. 
<br><br>
Victor: It’s called “arrastão.” It’s like…they have these huge nets, almost like huge fishing nets. Here they are called “Redes de arrastão”, or drag nets.
<br><br>
>>>Where did this happen to you?? 
<br><br>
Luciana: On the highway. 
<br><br>
>>>In which area?? 
<br><br>
Luciana: When I was coming into Rio from my city, my hometown. 
<br><br>
>>>What? In the car?? 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah. My brother was driving, and I was sitting behind him. My nephew and my brother’s wife was there too. Many men came with weapons up to the car, and took everything. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s terrible!!
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah, it was terrible. I had been robbed before, but not in that way…not good. It happened around 3, 4 years ago.
<br><br>
Victor: For me, the worst…it’s hard to say worst because I’ve had a few terrible moments, all losses. I had three really close relatives pass away around the same time. My cousin, who was like a brother to me, my grandfather who was like another father to me, and my mother. All three got cancer, and passed away, one year, the next year, and on. My mother was sick for years—10 years. So yeah those times were hard. 
<br><br>
>>>How long ago was this?? 
<br><br>
Victor: The last person was my mother, and that was in 2010. So 5 years ago. 
<br><br>
>>>You were still so young!! 
<br><br>
Victor: Yeah…my cousin got Sarcoma cancer, cancer on the bone of the face. That was terrible. He died in two years…and my grandfather, it was almost an instant. He had it in the brain.   He passed away in 3 months. 
<br><br>
Luciana: He had cancer in the stomach and lungs too, but there were no symptoms. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow…wow. I think it’s time to talk about happy times.
<br><br>
Victor: Yeah (laughs). Yeah it happens. And regarding happy times…in all this craziness I had during that time, I realized that true happiness is when you are OK with yourself. I don’t know how to say it in English…tranquil? 
<br><br>
Luciana: Relaxed? 
<br><br>
Victor: Not really relaxed it’s more…there is a word but I can’t think of it. It’s like you are in a meditative state. But not even that. You feel whole. You feel fulfilled, you feel good. And you can look at things and the world from a child’s perspective… Or through children’s eyes. 
<br><br>
>>>Like an innocence? 
<br><br>
Victor: Yeah. When you are a child, you see the world the way it is. You are just observing. I’ve always been searching for these moments because when I was a kid I had a lot of them and I loved them. I was easy with myself, and was really happy. And now, we are finally starting to get “there.” In a constant way, to that state. Since we’ve moved, we’ve been keeping this up. We have our own house, making things around you, a place to live. It’s given us a new feeling. A fulfilment in a new way. 
<br><br>
Luciana: You’re talking too much! (laughs)
<br><br>
Victor: Sorry.  
<br><br>
Luciana: My happiest moments were when I was a child. But looking on that…I can say we are happy now. 
<br><br>
Victor: It’s like what I said. Childhood everyday! 
<br><br>
Luciana: Not everyday, but most of the time. Because you know, women have PMS (everyone laughs). So it’s not everyday (laughs). 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Luciana: When I was a child, I wanted…[Speaks in Portuguese to Victor]…yeah, I wanted to help others. 
<br><br>
>>>Because you LOVE PEOPLE!!!!!
<br><br>
Luciana: (Laughs) Yeah!! I don’t know why!! (Laughs again) Yeah, and I designed in my mind an object that would help everybody. It was a tree that grows money! Money for everybody!! (Everyone laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>A philanthropist at such a young age…amazing. What would you tell her now?? 
<br><br>
Luciana: I don’t know…[Discusses in Portuguese to Victor]…I’m still trying!! (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Still trying to make that tree! 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yes!! Ahhh my English… Sorry… (laughs) I need to practice more! 
<br><br>
>>>No no no, you’ve been great!! 
<br><br>
Victor: I had a lot of dreams, mainly to become a Superhero. But in terms of professions, I wanted to do a lot of things. But what I wanted to do the most that I can remember was to become an inventor. I always loved learning about Da Vinci, the sciences, yeah. So when we did the equivalent of the SAT’s here, I chose physics. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow…we have a smart man in front of us here. 
<br><br>
Victor: (Laughs) Yeah, so I wanted to be an inventor, and when I realized this as an adult, I had actually already gotten there!! I did it unconsciously (laughs). Without knowing it! And if I had to say something to me as a child, I think he would be fascinated. He would be like “WOW!!” “COOL!!”(everybody laughs).
<br><br>
>>>No wonder you guys are happy everyday! (Everybody laughs) So what’s your dream now?? You guys have already gotten a hot product line up and running, already inventors / designers! 
<br><br>
Luciana: [Speaks Portuguese to Victor]…I…really…want to help people?? (Everybody laughs)
<br><br>
>>>I thought your money-giving tree was a metaphor! (laughs)
<br><br>
Victor: I think what she’s trying to say is, now she really wants to help people, in the practical sense. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh I see, not give them money, but help them out. 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yes!! 
<br><br>
Victor: So yeah, not in a indirect way, like giving money, but more directly through Bolei. Helping the environment, through our work, in a more direct way. This is something we’ve been talking about. More of a direct effort. She wants to actually see the people happy at the end of the road. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow I’ve never met a person who loves people so much!! 
<br><br>
Luciana: Yeah, I want to have a conversation with the man sleeping on the street! 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, they’re always sleeping huh. 
<br><br>
Luciana: Oh, but after they finish sleeping. I won’t wake him up (everyone laughs). I won’t be like “Hey! Wake up!! Let’s talk!!”
<br><br>
Victor: “I have a tree that grows money!!” (Everybody laughs) “It’s called coconuts! You can sell them on the beach!!” (Everyone laughs again)
<br><br>
No, no… but for me it’s to…this might sound a little crazy, but it’s to build a life that we’re building now, but more in a structural way. Does that make sense? To design our life, to be happy. And on a long term scale. This is something I’ve been reflecting on, thinking about for a long time. How can we do that, design a life so we can be happy. And when you’re happy, you make the people around you happy. So yeah, be like that.  
<br><br>
