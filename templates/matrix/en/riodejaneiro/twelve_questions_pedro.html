    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in Rio de Janeiro：10~11<br>
     <br>  
      I can not reiterate enough how lucky I was to end up staying at Roberta and Pedro's place through Airbnb. Pedro is just a world-class individual. He is a lawyer turned social entrepreneur with his own startup; his business is publishing children’s books where the children themselves are the authors and illustrators, with even the opportunity have their own autograph days and characters turned into actual dolls or stuffed animals. Yeah, you don’t get much cooler than that. Pedro’s playful personality and second-to-none work ethic (he literally was reading dozens of books at a time on weekends!) was also something I truly respected. He would even push me, asking me “How are you better today compared to yesterday?” each evening when we met up!! Amazing. For his answers, I recommend the future (Q.6), awake/sleep (Q.10), his moments (Q.11), and his dreams (Q.12). So Pedro, see you around, and I know you will be successful so wish me luck haha. And come to Japan with Roberta!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: Here? Here is my office. It's probably part of my life (laughs), my company. I think …well, after family it's the thing that I value most. 
<br><br>
>>>Well, that's one of the questions, so you have answered it already! haha 
<br><br>
 >>>What! Okay. I didn't read it. I promise! (Laughs)
  </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/pedro/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   So I could go to more than one place? 
<br><br>
>>> You can go to more than one place if you think you can spend, but you only have 2,000, 2,500. It doesn't include flying but, you know, if you're in a lot of different places it might be expensive. 
<br><br>
So there are so many places to go. Maybe… I'd go with Roberta to California, to the Silicone Valley, to meet some guys there, to get some more knowledge, meet some start-ups, probably. And maybe with $2,500, I'm not sure if I could do that, but maybe going there and resting a week in Punta Cana just having some fun and sun. 
<br><br>
>>>Vacation time? 
<br><br>
Yeah. Like one week. If I were on vacation. 
<br><br>
>>> So three weeks in Silicone Valley and one week in...? 
<br><br>
Punta Cana. 
<br><br>
>>> Where is that? 
<br><br>
 It's in Central America. I don't know the name of the country in English. República Dominicana. 
<br><br>
 >>>Oh, Dominican Republic!

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Other than Brazil? Probably Argentina's very close. Our culture is really similar. You have the Mexicans. The Mexicans are maybe even closer because they are… happier than the Argentinians and they are less arrogant (Leo laughs). So I think we are a lot like the Mexicans, Colombians, Argentinians. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/pedro/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 One thing and one place that represents the city of Rio? Oh, the beach. The beach is probably one of the reasons… No, I can say the beach, I could amplify the answer and say maybe the nature. The beach, the green, the trees, the blue of the sky. It's probably one of the reasons I love so much living here. I wake up and I come to the office. I come through the beach and every time I’m thankful for living here. 
<br><br>
>>>You take the beach route? 
<br><br>
Yeah!  
<br><br>
>>>I see. All right, great. So I guess that is both the thing and place.  
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   (Thinking)… So first, thinking of redesigning that, I have to think about what that represents now, and that's so the green is the nature, the yellow is the gold… I would probably take out the gold. That doesn't make too many sense to me. And… yeah. I like the Brazilian flag. I'm really proud of that, but the meaning of that, that doesn't make sense for me. The gold represents a period of time that-- we can be proud of when we're being explored? by the Portuguese. 
<br><br>
>>> Exploited? 
<br><br>
 No, explore? Explore? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, they're exploring Brazil. 
<br><br>
Yeah. When you're being explored by them. Can I say that? 
<br><br>
>>>You don't really say-- You don't become explored. The Portuguese were exploring Brazil. 
<br><br>
No, its because I'm making a bad translation, because in Portuguese, what the Portuguese were doing to Brazil was “explorar”. “Explorar” can be exploring in some way, but I think not in this way. So the Portuguese were here taking out our wealth, and…yeah, maybe that. But I'm really okay with our flag. I like it. 
<br><br>
>>>Okay. That's pretty cool. I now know the meaning behind it. The blue is the world? 
<br><br>
No, the blue is the ocean. The blue is the sky or the ocean. I'm not sure.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
 —The Ocean<br>
The ocean. So the ocean, if you tell me about the ocean… probably I'll think about the Earth. And… after that I'll think about Brazil. 
<br><br>
>>>Why do you think about the Earth? 
<br><br>
The Earth? Because the ocean...if I zoom it out, the Earth is all about the ocean. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
The sun...all these questions take me to Rio (Laughs). So the sun is probably the representation of Rio. I look like a guy that's really proud of our city. Okay, it probably is. 
<br><br>
>>>If I was living in Rio I'd be proud of your city. 
<br><br>
Yeah, but your questions take me to...if you ask me about “nature”, the nature for me is Rio. If you were asking me about “buildings” I'd say Sao Paolo. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 Death? (Thinking)…death…that's transcendency. 
<br><br>
>>>Transcendentalism. “Going to the next”, right? 
<br><br>
Yeah, the next level. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
  Less inequality. I think that the technology maybe… the technology makes really poor people live in a better situation. For example, people that don't have water for drinking now, in 2025, probably, almost everybody on earth will have access to water. I could talk a lot about that, about future. I think about… more… I think that of course, people are going to live longer. I think we may have more conflicts between countries. (Thinking)… I could talk so much about that. I think about that a lot. 
<br><br>
>>>That's your job, and you're reading a lot about this kind of stuff, and it's your job too. Why do you think there's going to be more conflict between countries? 
<br><br>
Hmmm……I’m organizing the information in my head. 
<br><br>
>>>Go ahead and take your time. 
<br><br>
(Takes a few minutes)…So I think… this stage of our society… some countries are… the countries that are emerging, or are on the top of the world economically, I think they will fight more to be the first one, and that's going to be more dangerous. I don't see… I can't see peace when I see China and the U.S. as rivals. I don't see peace when I see Russia and the entire world. I see more conflicts about conquering the world, and I think that globalization will take us to that. Makes sense for you?
<br><br>
>>> It makes sense. It's interesting because your initial thought just seemed like—Well, because your initial thought was that technology will make it so that there will be less inequality— it seemed like more of a positive outcome
<br><br>
Yeah, I'm really positive about the future. It makes it seem I'm not that positive, but I think that countries, in a way, they're fighting more to be more powerful, and… I see some stuff happening that I think, “oh no, everybody wants to take control of the world”. And I think Brazil's kind of a nation that can be an example, a benchmark, because we're a huge country. We're one of the ten biggest economies in the world and we’ve never try to colonize. Colonize? Is that the word? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, wow. You're right. 
<br><br>
 We never try to colonize anybody. We never tried to be the owner of the world. We just had one war in our history. That was against Paraguay, which was really unfair. Brazil was not fair during that, but okay. So Brazil is really peaceful…But no, the story of the world is always about disputes, and in the past it was more just we are here fighting here and nobody else, but now it's getting bigger and bigger. So when, for example, the Vikings in Europe and now that the world is so, like, everybody knows everybody and everybody wants to take control of everything. For example, the U.S. goes to Afghanistan to take control of that, to be the leader of the region, and Russia doesn't like the U.S. because they know that the U.S. wants to take control of their neighborhood, and yeah, I can see some conflicts. And I can see Brazil as a peaceful leader.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
 For me? For me is my girlfriend. My girlfriend… just one thing? But for me, the most important things is probably my girlfriend, my family and friends, and my work. Yeah, I think that's all that really matters for me. 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
   Like personal life? What do I look for? I look for… living, for passion, for loyalty, for… somebody that I can share my experience and I can share my happiness and my sadness. No, I can multiply my happiness and I can share my sadness. 
<br><br>
>>>Cool. 
<br><br>
 Yeah. And… yeah, that's my partner, that's Roberta, is somebody I want to take to the rest of my life. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/pedro/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yes! Yes. But I think that the future… you're going to say “you're talking bullshit”, but anyway, I don't need this formality. For me being married is like living together. For me getting knowledge not going to school, it's you observing knowledge, the way you prefer. I don't like “marriage”. So I think I would get married because society claims we have to get married, but I'm happy enough living together, being together, and sharing experience. But yes, I want to marry. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you want children? 
<br><br>
 Yes. 
<br><br>
>>>Okay, so is there anything you want to do with your children, or is there anything you have in how you want them to grow up? 
<br><br>
 Yeah, I think I'm going to be more cliche. When I think about children, I think about happiness, and I’d like my children to be really happy. I would probably be more open-minded than my parents were with me, and…yeah. I think that I'd probably ask my children to do something like you're doing now (Leo laughs). I think… that you have to get experience, to look for experience. Yeah, and… I think you have to enjoy your life, so get as many experience as you can. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 That's both my girlfriend. 
<br><br>
>>>Well that was an easy answer.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah, I like to wake up every day and see her sleep with me, and I like to go to bed and see her. Actually, I prefer sleeping first. She’s kind of boring when she’s sleeping! (Laughs) She doesn't talk haha 

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/pedro/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 I don't want to say “the happiest”. I don't have a specific moment to tell you. Maybe I would say that my… I think my life now is my happiest moment. I couldn't be more happy than I am. I thank God for everything I have, for the girlfriend I have, for having our house, being healthy, doing the things I love, so if I had to tell you, I'd say the happiest moment is “always”. No, it's not always, but it's always “today”. And the most terrifying moments is… Man, I'm going to give you an answer that's really bullshit, but always when somebody has to take my blood.
<br><br>
 >>>Oh, interesting. I never knew that. 
<br><br>
Yeah, I'm so terrified about that that I… yeah, it's kind of stupid, because I have a phobia about that. 
<br><br>
>>>Is it a blood phobia or is it the pointy phobia? 
<br><br>
Both. (Both! Leo laughs) The thing is that I have a phobia of both. So when that combines, when I have to do that, I can't sleep in the previous day. I say “oh… fuck”. Yeah, so last time I did that was because I have a friend, and his girlfriend, she was dying, she had cancer, and she needed blood. And that's the only reason that I would do that, and unfortunately she died. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh no…
<br><br>
Yeah. She was 23. She had a really rare cancer. I think Hodgkin’s lymphoma, something like that. Have you heard about it? Hodgkin’s something. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, Hodgkin’s disease. 
<br><br>
 It's a kind of cancer, you know? 
<br><br>
 >>>Yeah… That's terrible. 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Okay, so when I was a child I had two dreams. I… had a dream of being a pilot, an airplane pilot, and I had a dream of in some way I'd like to change the world, to make the world a better place. 
<br><br>
>>>How old were you when you had this dream? 
<br><br>
 When I was a kid. Like in Brazil, when we see this stuff that happened every single day here, we… really reflect about that and we think that's so unfair. “Why should that be like that”. And I think I’m… So when I was eighteen and became a pilot I chose the first part of my dream, or my first— 
<br><br>
>>>You actually became a pilot!?!? 
<br><br>
Yeah.
>>>What?  So you know how to fly planes!?!? 
<br><br>
Yeah. And the second part, I'm kind of doing that now, through the company. 
<br><br>
>>>But you’re also a lawyer.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. Being a lawyer's like a hobby. (Laughs)
<br><br>
 Oh, Pedro… All right, what is your dream now?
<br><br>
My dream now? My dream now is… yeah, I keep my dream of changing the world some way I'd like to… when I go to the next level I'd like to stop, reflect, and be sure that in some way I made the world a better place. So… yeah, I keep doing my dream every single day when I come to work. I don't get too much money but I'm really happy for doing that.
