    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in Rio de Janeiro： 11 years (0~6, 23~28)<br>
     <br>  
      Roberta (and her boyfriend Pedro) were my Airbnb hosts in Rio, and I have to say I was the luckiest person in all of Zona Sul to be able to stay with these two amazing people. Roberta is just an incredibly thoughtful, kind, considerate, smart, and genuines person with an amazing flowing voice that made her English a pleasure to listen to everyday (I didn't tell her this in person becasue I didn't want to sound like a creep lol). Roberta showed me around PUC,  an amazing univesrsity located in the western side of Zona Sul with canals, wild monkeys, and some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen haha. For the questions, Roberta gave simple and thoughful answers reflecting her inner Brazilian, and I would recommend her partner (Q.8), marriage/children (Q.9), wake up/go to bed (Q.10), and her moments (Q.11). Again, thanks for everything Roberta, and I know I will see you soon!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: So this is PUC, it's Pontifícia Universidade Católica. It's a catholic university here in Rio. A very traditional one. It's a private school and it's where I started my first graduation course.
<br><br>
>>>After you quit being a dentist?
<br><br>
Yeah, after I quit being a dentist.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   (Thinking) I want to go to so many places…(Thinking) …but I don't think 6,000 Reals…(Thinking)… I definitely would go to the west again, to Disneyland just to satisfy the child inside me. I think I would like to go to Thailand or an exotic place, too. To just chill out there and relax. 
<br><br>
>>>You're in an exotic place. 
<br><br>
Yeah haha but a little bit different from Rio. 
<br><br>
>>> Like a vacation to some place. 
<br><br>
 But I would like to go to Miami do some shopping, too. Just to spend money on clothes and...
<br><br>
>>>Why Miami, though?
<br><br>
I think it's a Brazilian thing. All the Brazilians want to go to Miami to do shopping. If you go there you hear a lot of people speaking Portuguese. 

 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  I think any place in South America. I think that the culture is similar to what we have here. All the family together and friends that kiss everybody and we hug everybody. So I think that would be close to Brazil. 
<br><br>
>>>So any country in South America? 
<br><br>
Any “warm” country. I mean warm like the relationship between people. Maybe in Italy people are like "Oh, hi! How are you?" (Hugs and kisses)
<br><br>
>>>I see so its more of the warm feeling and less so a country! 
<br><br>
Yeah! 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/roberta/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 Can it be just one place? Or can it be two places?
<br><br>
>>>Two places if you can two places. 
<br><br>
I think during the day, being on the beach just talking to friends and drinking beer I think that represents Rio. And Lapa at night also drinking beers with friends. That's really Rio. 
<br><br>
>>>What do you think is one thing? 
<br><br>
 (Thinking)…So here… I don't know if there's one thing but we have the Carioca way of life… Say "Rio" to me, I will think like someone really cool with flip-flops, Havaianas, and people leave their work and they go to a bar and… just being relaxed, that is the Carioca way of life. Don't worry about things.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   I don't think aesthetically the Brazilian flag is beautiful. It's not. Although I have pride… I like to see my flag when I go abroad and say "Oh, a Brazilian flag!” It's not that beautiful. But what it represents, I think, its cool—the green for the forests and everything. I don't know if I would redesign it, even though I don’t really like it.

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
I want to say the ocean is like Copacabana Beach for me. It's impossible to think of something else. That would be like Copacabana Beach in the morning. The sun rising and you see the whole ocean. That's what I think. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
 (Thinking)… You could say beach again, but then I need to be more creative. (Thinking)… Maybe some barbecues with friends and a swimming pool. 
<br><br>
>>>Being outside.
<br><br>
Yeah. I think like on a summer day. A very hot sun. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
 (Thinking) It's weird because its something that I don't like to think about. I think there is no image but the feeling is like a desperate feeling like I don't want to be there. I know that I will be there one day but... It's just a bad feeling. Is that OK? To be a feeling? 
<br><br>
>>>Of course! Any answer is OK
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 (Thinking) Ok… So about my future I think... I think generally speaking I think people are getting more conscious about what they really want. Like in my parents time they would work because they need to get money, to get married, and to have kids. Now I think people are changed. Like you (Leo) are traveling the world because this is your project and that's what you want to do. Then I changed my career because that's what I want to do. I see this in other people, too. I think, at least, the future will be like more fun for other people. That's what I think. 
<br><br>
>>>That's a very positive way of thinking. 
<br><br>
Yeah (Laughs) I like to be positive. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you have an image for Brazil? Brazil's going through a lot of change right now. That's why I ask.
<br><br>
Brazil… Now we are having a very negative moment.  We’re having some problems. I think it'll get better. I think there will not be a revolution but something will happen, something will, something must happen. Brazil has the potential to be really big.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Family. 
<br><br>
>>> Who would you consider your family? What is a Brazilian family?
<br><br>
Family for me is my parents, my siblings, my boyfriend, of course, and my aunts. They're fun. Family for us is like the big family. I mean, I don't have contact with <i>all</i> my cousins and anything like that but, I like family. I like to know that everybody's together that I can call if I need anything. I will be there for them and then they will be there for me, too.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah! Just on Sunday we had Pedro’s sister with us. I saw it first hand! 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  I already found what I look for. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>That's going to come out good on the interview! 
<br><br>
 (Laughs) Someone that's really a partner. That will encourage me to do the things that I want. To peruse my dreams… He's very comprehensive, so intelligent, and so cool. Yeah, he's just the perfect guy.
<br><br>
>>>Ooh!! 
<br><br>
Yeah, I love him very much.
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/roberta/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
  Do you want to get married?  Yes, definitely. Yeah. <br>
 Do you want children?  Yes. 
<br><br>
>>> Is they're anything you want to do with them once they're a little bit older and they're not just babies any more but children or even young adults? Do you have an image of how you want them to grow up. 
<br><br>
Yeah, it's fun. We talk a lot about it because Pedro's field of work is in education.  So there are a lot of things I say "Oh, we're not going to do that with our kids." The experience like we're having, for example, I'm not going to do like a lot of parents do: "Oh, go to medicine school” or “be an architect” or just “be something." This is fun. When he came there and Pedro said "Oh, this is cool what Leo is doing." And then said "Oh my god, we definitely will send our kid, go travel a year, go meet people, and see the value of everyone." So this is an experience we want him or her to have. And just being a kid he will do it at 18 or 20 years old. But when he's a kid, this is something important, we don't want to give any pressure to our kids. Just let them be what they want to be. That's it. 
<br><br>
>>>Cool!  Did you feel pressure as a child? This is just my personal question.
<br><br>
Ok…No… Sometimes I think my parents were really cool to me. They should be a little bit tougher. 
<br><br>
>>>Haha! You seem to have turned out all right.
<br><br>
I mean college I did not because they forced me to apply but they influenced me. So sometimes I like to say "Oh, this is your fault. I did dental school because of you." But they were just trying to help me. I couldn't see that at the time.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
  I don’t want to be too romantic… but I love when I wakeup and see Pedro is there and we always hug each other, say "Good morning." This is really nice. When I go sleep the same thing we always say "Thank you for being in my days." This is something I like to sleep hearing the "Thanks for being in my day.”
<br><br>
>>>What is it in Portuguese?
<br><br>
Obrigada por fazer parte do meu dia. Thanks for being part of my day.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I see. At least it starts with "obrigado," I got that far. (Laughs) So it's the same answer?
<br><br>
Yeah.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 (Thinking) Happiest. So many happy moments. What is the happiest… I would say this one because I think it was the most recent one. When I passed in Vestibular, the national test we must do to get into college, and after 10 years studying nothing of high school lessons and then I was able to get into a public university (Note: The top universities in Rio are public). I got in second place in the material engineering. For me it was something incredible. I feel like I was the best person in the world! 
<br><br>
>>>Wow! Number two! And that’s 10 years removed from high school… Did you do a lot of studying?
<br><br>
I studied for a year to take the test. Because the time I had to be in the university, when I was 17, I didn't pass. Then after 10 years I passed. So for me it was something like "Oh my god!" 
<br><br>
>>>That's amazing!
<br><br>
Yeah, I was like “I’m not stupid!” (laughs). I can do the things I want. I think it was the happiest.
<br><br>
>>>And the most terrifying moment.
<br><br>
 (Thinking) I can't remember…(Thinking)… Yeah, maybe I don't have one. Because that would be something really traumatic so I would remember. I don't know. I believe I don't remember any terrifying moment.
<br><br>
>>>Living in "The most dangerous city in the world" you're doing a pretty good job if you don't have a terrifying moment. This'll come out good. It'll be good PR for Rio haha 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
When I was very little I think all the children were like "Oh, I want to be an astronaut." Then I remember I wanted to be a plane pilot. (Laughs) Then I remember wanting to be a scientist. I really wanted to wear the white jacket and do all the things. It's fun, now I'm not working in a lab, but I'm studying to be a researcher. I would tell her "Hey, you're getting there." 
<br><br>
 >>>And then what is your dream now? 
<br><br>
My dream is to work with what I really like, which are materials. Doing research. Personal dreams I would love to travel the world. I think that is not even a dream, but a goal. I don't care if I have money to have a mansion or anything like that I just want to have money enough to travel the world and meet new place, meet new people. That would be my dream. 
<br><br>
>>>What kind of materials do you like working with? I hear this is something I'm interested in.
<br><br>
Well… Now I'm changing. I don't have a specific material but I want to work with failure analysis. So something broke and then I'm going to see why it broke and what we can do to fix it 
<br><br>
 >>>An example of something would be? 
<br><br>
For example now I'm working with a crank shaft. It's a huge crank shaft and it broke. We're seeing why it broke and doing all the analysis. It's really cool! 
<br><br>
>>>You're having fun!
<br><br>
Yes I am!!
