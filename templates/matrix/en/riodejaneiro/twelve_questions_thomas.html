    <p><span class="name">Thomás Martin</span></p>
    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in Rio de Janeiro： 16<br>
     <br>  
    Thomás I met at Luciana's birthday party. He stood out 1, because of his long flowing blonde hair (the one type of hair you don't see much in the extremely diverse Rio), and 2, because he was dancing with his girlfriend (who is amazingly talented, busting out the splits without breaking a sweat!). Thomás is also extremely talented, being the drummer in the metal band Hatefulmurder, which got notice of its South America tour scheduling as I was doing my questions with Thomás! And of course Thomás himself, like most hard-core musicians I've gotten to know, was super kind and friendly, and I had a great time getting to know his background and thoughts. I really wish I could have gone out once more!! For the answers, I recommend the flag (Q.4), the thing (Q.7), his partner (Q.8), and his moments (Q.10). So Thomás, it was great meeting you! See you again, and come to Japan with your band!! <br><br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
  Place: Yeah. This place is Ipanema…  and I chose it because I think it represents the city, and me…because like it’s a…a free place, everybody can go. Very beautiful !
<br><br>
>>>So you like going to the ocean. 
<br><br>
Yes, I like to go to the ocean. Yeah. I think it…it unites things, like it is natural and peaceful, but at the same time, it’s an Asiatic area, the sea and the waves.  Sometimes they get high.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  I think I…I would go to East Europe——Eastern Europe…because it’s cheap.  So I could live with the two thousand five hundred. And I’m curious about people there. I’ve  been there for… like three days, and I liked it.  So I think I would like to know different places in Eastern Europe.
<br><br>
>>>What was it that specifically about Eastern Europe that you liked there?
<br><br>
What is that I liked there?  The people. And their different culture because the heritage they bring from the…like the communist thing… and the nightmare they had. But it’s good now there.
<br><br>
>>>I see the darker aspects…haha
<br><br>
(Laughs) No but I had a good feeling about it.
 </p>



<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  That’s definitely  Argentina. Yeah, because my father is from Argentina. So I’m very close to them.
<br><br>
>>>You’re a half and half just like me !
<br><br>
Yeah. I’m half Argentina.  Are you half what? 
<br><br>
>>>Half Japan, half American.
<br><br>
Nice. Yeah. I knew you’re not simple Japanese. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Do you go back often ?
<br><br>
Yeah, sometimes. Now I’m going back again ‘cause we’re playing there.
<br><br>
>>>The tour!?
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the Argentina show?  It confirmed today.
<br><br>
>>>Oh? Wow, a lot of things confirming today !
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ! Today’s a great day!

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 Yeah I think it’s this one, or the whole beach in general. Because a lot of different people come, and a lot of different people live here in the city, so… I think it represents how people can live together and share a good experience together.
<br><br>
>>>So, what would you think one thing is?  So, the beach is a place.
<br><br>
A thing that represents Rio?
<br><br>
>>>It could be the same answer. You sort of said that.
<br><br>
Yeah. I would say something related to the beach…a hat, or bikinis or something like that. (Laughs) 

 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Yeah. I…I think…I would…just when I read this question, you know, you showed me? Well, the first thing, I would put something diagonal here like this. It has those angles, but I think I would... I would make it diagonal.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting! Why?
<br><br>
I don’t know. I just spot it that way. And maybe with darker colors. Darker and bright colors, or something like black and  yellow. Yeah. (Laughs) Black and yellow stripes and diagonal here, like that. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>> Crazy, man! 
<br><br>
(Laughs) That’s…that would be my Brazilian flag. (Laughs)

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
An image--something like "the infinite".  Yeah. I think that’s it.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Life. I would say life.
<br><br>
—Which is interesting because the next word is…death. <br>
(Laughs) Death? …I would say the moon, but it wouldn’t be too obvious, right? When I... when you say death I think like a skull, yeah.
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
I try not to worry too much about the future, right, I think. And I have a feeling that it’s…it will go where it must go. Not some kind of destiny thing, but I think people will sort of…they will figure out what they have to do, I think. I used to be, you know, worry about my future and about the future of mankind. Now I think I have a more natural approach. I think it will naturally go where it must go. And it’s not bad. It’s not bad.


</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/thomas/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Ooh. The thing…the important thing?  Aha!  Life!
<br><br>
>>>Life? Could you elaborate? 
<br><br>
Because…What ? Why?  Because it brings movement, right ! When things are still, they’re not interesting. Yeah, so I think dynamics, movement. That's…that’s what’s cool.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  In a partner? Well, I look for thrill, emotion, right?
<br><br>
>>>Life !
<br><br>
 Yeah! Challenge ! That’s what I look for in a partner.
<br><br>
>>>Is it a specific kind or kinds of emotion?? 
<br><br>
Something like a challenge, not easy to get, yeah? That would bring pleasure, but all things that are very good, they are difficult, right? So I think if I...if I  chase something difficult, I would chase something good, or I have more chances of getting it. Don’t you think? Don’t you think that? Yeah.
  </p>
 

 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/riodejaneiro/twelve_questions/thomas/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yeah, yeah. <br>
Children:  Yeah. <br><br>

>>>Okay. Is there anything you want to do with your children? Is there an image of how you want them to grow up, how do you want them to become ?
<br><br>
Naturally I would like them to become passionate, especially as passionate as I think I am. I would like them to be more like me, like this feeling I have of chasing things and doing things great. I would like them to do it.
<br><br>
>>>Do you have something specific or could it be anything?
<br><br>
No, it could be anything. I… think on that is where you can have the individuality. Because I think it doesn’t matter too much what is it. I think it really doesn’t matter too much. I think what matters is "how". They can cook or make theatre or be an engineer or something! 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 When waking up.  Yeah...  I think it would be a very calm beach. A very calm beach with winds, sunny day. Yeah. On an island.
<br><br>
>>>Island? 
<br><br>
Yeah. On an island. That’s the place to wake up. Can be the place to sleep then too…yeah, it can be the place to sleep too. And in between? …Live anywhere else. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>So there’s a bed there, right, at least?
<br><br>
Yes!  In our bedroom, very close to the sands. On a bed…Yeah. I wake up in the bedroom and from the window, I see the beach …and the very tiny waves.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 (Sigh). I don’t know, man! I think I’m about to have the, the best moment of my life. I think it didn’t happen… still. It will happen. And…I think the bad moment will also come.
<br><br>
>>>So you think you will know for sure when that moment comes ? You’ll be like, “oh, this is the worst moment”, or will look back on it and be like, “that was the worst moment”?
<br><br>
Yeah, I think I will look back. Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>So that means it hasn’t happened yet? 
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting! Is there one moment, like one for each that you could talk about?  
<br><br>
 Of my “previous” life, you say? (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. Up until now. It could be something. 
<br><br>
Yeah. I think the... the achievements I made with the band, and releasing our first album, yeah, I think it was the best moment.
<br><br>
>>>Was it also a terrifying or frightening moment?
<br><br>
 Yeah for the whole process. Nothing…no, not afraid, but it was hard. But now we have soundtrack! 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Yeah. That’s to be a successful musician and…to make music and… get emotional for people. And I think I would tell my younger self to keep going. That’s why I am continuing.
<br><br>
>>>We actually have music behind us now all of a sudden.
<br><br>
Yeah. That’s a cool song.  
<br><br>
>>>It’s like, singing at the end !  Almost on cue! (Everyone laughs) All right! So your final dream…You say your dream now is to become a successful musician.
<br><br>
Yeah. And travel the world as that, just like you!
<br><br>
>>>You could probably. You’re already traveling South America and Central America. 
<br><br>
Yeah!
<br><br>
>>>You only need like five or six more continents!! haha
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s it! (Laughs)
