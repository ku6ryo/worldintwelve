  <div class="title">San Francisco × Berkeley Brunch</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
  <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So Leo loves to eat, so he is doing various food related sub-projects in each city. For this one, he meets people living in each city, and has a home made meal! </p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Who I Met</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So the home I went to in San Francisco was that of Alex and Eve Madonik. Technically their hose was in Berkeley but eh, its the Bay so that works, right? Eve is a professor of linguistics at the nearby UC Berkeley. Alex is a chemist, who said he recently frequents the UC Berkeley Chemistry frat, and hangs out with the students there. They met while studying at Harvard. Wow. They have been livin in Berkeley for over 30 years.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>The Madonik house is located just a 5 minute walk from the Berkeley BART station. Unlike many of the surrounding, Califonia-esque one-story houses, theirs had a second floor. </p>

    <br>
    <p>I had some trouble getting around on the BART, so I arrived late. And everything was ready!! I feel bad now... </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Berkeley is obviously famous as one of the Meccas of hippie culture, but recently, with Alice Waters at the helm, it is also famous for its ideas on the "right way to eat". The Madonik brunch went along those lines. According to Eve, ""Everything on this table, either we made it ourselves, or we know the face of the person who made it". The bread below was baked by ALex just that morning. It was hard and doughy at the same time, and very flovorful. </p>

    <p>Spread some butter on the bread, pull the smoked salmon, place some fennel, squeeze some lemon...パンにバターを塗り、スモークサーモンをほぐし、のせ、レモンを絞り、フェンネルを乗せる。</p>

    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/meal11.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>After brunch, I checked out the kitchen.</p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/kitchen1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/kitchen2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This wall is where the majority of the cooking utensils are located. There's even a a diagram on the side which tells you where to place each one back, for guests and relatives who use the kitchen. </p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/kitchen3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And a plethora of books on food and cooking located below.</p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/kitchen4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>After seeing the kitchen, Alex and Eve gave me a tour of Berkeley. But before that, I found their lemon tree in their front yard. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/tree1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Of course all grown organically, and of course never waxed, I can only imagine how grateful one must feel to be able to eat fresh lemons everyday. The lemon curd we ate at brunch was also home made, using these lemons. The only problem is the occasional lemon theif that appears. </p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/alexandeve/tree2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>After the tour of Berkeley, dessert!! A bavarian pudding made by one of Eve's friends, specially crafted so it uses rum instead of coffee, which Eve is allergic to. The sweetness of the pudding was a perfect match with the bitterness of the dark chocolate leaves. Very tasty. </p>
    <br>

    <br><br>
    <p><em>Final Thoughts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>Berkeley is avery interesting town, with both similarities and differences compared to San Francisco, and I really felt that "Berkeley-ness" in the brunch I ate that morning. Next time I'd like to check out more of that by maybe going to "Chez Panisse"?? And again, thank you very much for having me, Alex and Eve!!
