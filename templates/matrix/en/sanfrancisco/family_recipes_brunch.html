  <div class="title">San Francisco × Brunch Culture</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
    <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>Leo loves to eat, so he is doing various food related sub-projects in each city. For this one, he chooses a topic and does a little hands-on, "field work". Basically he goes to various resturants and eats!! Hurrah!!</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Theme</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So for San Francisco, I chose "Brunch Culture". I'm assuming the concept of brunch exists basically everywhere around the world, however I've never seen it so prominent as in San Francisco. Basically, brunch is like a religion. You have to eat it on the weekends. It's part of the "type of living" that fits in right with juicing, jogging, dog walking, and other themes in San Francisco. It's a necessity to start off your day on the right foot, and eating a nice brunch is just that. All three of my roommates ate brunch almost every Saturday and Sunday, either with girlfriends, groups of friends, or even with dates found on an app!! So I decided to do the same, and went to a few popular places.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My first brunch experience was "MyMy's Coffee Shop". It was a recommended by my brunch loving roommate Pat and his foodie girlfriedn Saniya. They said this place serves some of the best pancakes in San Francisco. So I arrived around 1:30 pm, not even brunch time anymore, and yet there were still people in line! </p>

    <br>
  　<p>Outside seating is full, even in January!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/mymy3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The waiting list is long...</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/mymy4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This is the menu. I had the "Pancakes with chives, bacon bits, and gorgonzola". </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>And this is it. Comes with two eggs, which was awesome!! </p>

    <br>
    <p>And I felt like a king!! The home-made lemonade was also delicious. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/mymy9.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The scent of the cheeze, the sweetness of maple syrup, and the savory bacon all creating a beautiful harmony in my mouth. Then there was the egg, which added gooey deliciousness, was the icing on the top. I was in heaven. Officially the best pancakes I've ever eaten in my life, and maybe the best single item I ate in San Francisco! </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>= = = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>The next Sunday I went to "Sweet Maple", famous for its "Million Dollar Bacon". </p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm11.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I heard it was pretty popular, and I was worried that the line might be long. And boy it was. </p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm12.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>People were waiting on the other side of the block!! And it was almost 1pm!!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm13.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I asked the waiter how long the wait was, and she said 2~3 hours. No, not waiting that much!! So I head over to the boulangerie chain of San Francisco, "La Boulange".</p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/boulange1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>There's the boulangerie version, and the cafe version, which I went to.</p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/boulange2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Delicious looking breads of all sorts.</p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/boulange3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>From jams to pickles, take as much as you want!!</p>
    <br>

   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/boulange5.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And here's the french toast, with a side of fruit. I just love California and its abundance of fruite. You get it everywhere you go, and its absoluteley amazing. </p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/boulange6.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The french toast has the amazing melt-in-your-mouth texture. I don't know if you can even call it "toast" anymore. And overflowing with maple syrup. America!! </p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/boulange7.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>= = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>So I heard from a dude who used to live near Sweet Maple that "There really aren't too many people there on the weekdays" so I arrived on a Wednesday. </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm21.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And true enough, there were no people lined up, and I actually saw empty seats!! </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm22.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And here is the "Million Dollar Bacon". It's actually about 7 dollars, which is still expensive for just bacon. Supposedly this bacon is listed as one of the best bacons by the prominent bacon association of the US. Its a thick slice, cooked with various spices, and dazzled with maple syrup. Its good, but really, a "million dollars?" </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm23.jpg"></p>
    <br>
     <p>The pancake.</p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm24.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>It was a thin pancake, so not very heavy, which was nice. And it was great combination with the tart of the fruit, </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm25.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>also a great combination with the savory bacon. Aaaahhh...</p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/sm26.jpg"></p>
    <br>
　　<p>= = = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lastly, more of a twist. A brunch I ate in Berkeley at a Indian restaurant called "Venus". </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/venus1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I loved the hand drawn SNS apps on the chalkboard.</p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/venus2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And the place was FULL!! There seemed to be a famous/popular place next door with a 20 person wait, but this place was packed too. </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/venus3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This is the menu. I ordered the "Indian Brunch" which consisted of a carrot and zucchini pancake, tomato-chili pepper-cilantro akoori scrambled eggs, mango aioli, home-made chapati and banana raita. Wow. </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/venus4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And this is it. How should I put it...it was delicious, but it didn't really feel like I was eating brunch. However, it did satisfy the sweet-and-savory craving that people have toward brunch (more on this later), so that was good. </p>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/family_recipes/brunch/venus5.jpg"></p>
    <br><br>
    <p><em>Final Thoughts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So thats it. To tell you the truth, I had a few other, not as extensive brunches other than this, and after the whole ordeal my honest opinion was "I've had enough brunch for a while" haha. Yeah, brunch is nice on a Saturday or Sunday, not 3 times a week!! A few points below. <br><br>
    1. This is obvious for people who know brunch, but brunch is all about "Sweet and Savory". As you can tell, I usually had a sweet main (pancakes, french toast, etc.) and a savory side (bacon, sausages, etc.). But you can also have the opposite, a savory main (Eggs Benedict, Soufule, etc.), and have a sweet side (danish, toast, etc.). Also, the fact that every place serves eggs to your desire is great (sunny side up, scrambles, poached, ect.), so you can always get the ultimate combination of sweet+savory+melts-in-your-mouth!!<br><br>
    2. So I know that many other cities in the US and the world have places that serve brunch, but I've never seen it so prevalent throughout the daily lives of everybody. They <i>have</i> to have it on the weekends, as seen with "Sweet Maple" where people wait for 3 hours to get into a place that requires no wait on the weekdays. Its so important to them to eat on the weekend, and I think that's the essence of brunch culture in San Francisco. The end.
