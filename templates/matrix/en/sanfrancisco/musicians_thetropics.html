    <p>Bio from site: The Tropics descended on San Francisco during the peak of the city's cultural identity crisis to uphold the timeless essence of the city that has been drawing the starry-eyed masses westward for decades.
<br><br>
Fueled by the power of discovery and young wist, the group forged a collection that perfectly captures that very essence in five flawless tracks on their debut, Wind House. Check out some of their tunes at the site below, or click on the play button.</p>

    <p>Leo's Take: Claire, the lead vocalist told me I should come to the The Tropics show at the Rickshaw Stop while I was in San Francisco. I went, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. Not exaggerating. The venue was absoluely amazing, the DJ (and coordinator, who I later learned is a major player in the SF indie music scene) was frankly, a genius, and the Tropics were...how should I put it, well, they were stars. They will be stars. They just had that flare, the charisma you don't see in many bands. It was one of those moments I was happy to be alive.  </p>
