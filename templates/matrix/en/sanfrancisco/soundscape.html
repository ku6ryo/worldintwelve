   <div class="title">Soundscape: San Francisco</div>
   <p>As always, everything you hear in the soundscape are actual sounds I recorded while my stay in that city. However, some sounds are modified a little, just so they sound better (getting rid of wind, background noise, etc.) I will give hints below, so try seeing what you can figure out!! (Oh and use of headphones is advised!!)</p>

    <p><em>Some Places:</em><br>
    The Mission, Alta Plaza Park, The Ferry Building, A Private School in
    Pacific Heights, Berkeley</p>
