  <div class="title">Place: Subterranean Art House  Date: 1/25/2014</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
    <p>The last Monday of January, 2015. I was at the "Subterranean Art House", an event space for art and culture in Berkeley which I had visited the previous week. Rhishikesh Limaye, one of the curators said to me, "You should use this space for you Treasure Box project" and I was more than delighted. After that, with the help of one of my "12Qs" interviewees Catlin, we started finding artists who might want to participate. Rhishi even did some PR on the Art House's wbsite!! </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/facebook.png"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I found one participant, and Catlin found two. I was actually overbooked!! I couldn't believe it until...</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/arthouse.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>No one showed up. Well, to be honest, I got a text from my participant the previous night that her work shift had been rescheduled and she wouldn't be able to make it. As for Catlin's friends, one was really excited for the project until he woke up the morning of the event and decided "he wanted to be by himself" that day, and the other was actually physically with Catlin that morning until he told her he needed to go home once, left for a BART station, and now was unreachable. Hmmm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After an hour or so sitting in an empty space with Catlin, chatting about this an that, "Treasure Box Battle: San Francisco" met its destiny: cancellation. I was thinking of all the things I should have done (which I'll point out at the end of this segment), when Catlin told me she would show me around Oakland, where there was one, Burning Man statues, and two, a house where her friend lived with a few artists. Well, I needed <i>something</i> to put on this page so... </p>
     <br>
  　<p>So a twenty minute drive down to Oakland and here are the statues!!</p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/burner.jpg"></p>
    <br>
  　<p>The statues were located in a open space behind a giant factory. And there were tons of these statues. If you want to know what a burning man is, click here!! Also we couldn't go in the actual factory space, so I only have pictures from outside. </p>
   <br>
  　<p>After that we went to Catlin's friend's house. It was located in west Oakland which is...well lets jsut say its a little different from San Francisco. Seeing Oakland with my own eyes for the first time, I understood why Damian Lillard on the Portland Trail Blazers is so tough, gritty, and plays with so much passion. It's also much cheaper to live in compared to the city, so many artists reside here. </p>
  <br>
  　<p>Catlin's friend's house looked pretty normal on the outside, but what was cool was there was a basement floor where all the different residences had their ateliers. The house hosts a sculptor, stylist, visual artist, and Catlin's friend who is a muscian and a cook(?). Below is the chair and hair washer used by the stylist. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>And the stylist's mirror.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The visual artist's space.</p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>With a lot of spare wood. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Various glass bottles in dfferent shapes and sizes.</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab5.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>There's even a kitchen. Here the spice rack.</p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab6.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The stove.</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab7.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>And even dishes!! I'll reiterate this point, but this is all underneath the house on a basement floor. Yeah, I can see why it would be difficult trying to find this in the city...</p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/lab8.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>= = = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>A lot of the art was decorated in the living room.</p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/living1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I liked how the iPad charger and internet modem were snuggled between the oranges and onions. </p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/living2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>So here it is. 12 pieces of art I found in the living room. You know, going with the whole "12" thing. </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/art11.jpg"></p> <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/treasure_box/art12.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>So, how was it?? Esoteric?? Yeah, me too. But there were a number of pieces I liked. </p>
    <br><br>
  
    <p><em>Final Thoughts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>As shown above, "Treasure Box Battle: San Francisco" did never come to fruition. So I'd just finish off by making a couple of points on what I learned from this experience. <br><br>
    1. "Understand which type of artist I'm dealing with"： So the entirety of the "World in Twelve" relies on asking peole who I've never met to take time out of their lives to help me out on my personal project. And since I'm not paying anybody anything, the only thing that holds together me and that person is trust. I'm not saying that artists in general are lacking in that department, but its true that say, they are less likely to be in constant contact than businessmen lol. What's important to understand is, even within the wide category of "artist", there are the people who are paying their bills with their art, and there are the types that are well, lets just say "fine artists". The former, I've had no problem corresponding with in any of my projects, but the latter, they do have their spontaneous "want to be alone days", etc. I mean, this wasn't the first time I've been put off. Anyway, going along for the rest of the year, I'll have to be careful in tryin to choose the former type for help on my project.<br>
    2. "Try to be in constant contact"： However, saying that, its going to be impossible to only get the former type. I'll just try to be in constant contact with artists, sending reminders and such. This time might have turned out different if I had done more of this. 
    <br><br>
    So that's it. Let's hope Toronto works out!!
