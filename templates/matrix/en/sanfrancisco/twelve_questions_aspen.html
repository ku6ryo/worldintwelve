    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：25　Years in San Francisco：2 1/2 <br>
     <br>Aspen was introduced to me through my childhood friend Jennifer. During my stay in San Francisco, Aspen a jazz vocalist, introduced me to a number of things: nice jazz bars, tasty shrimp burritos, and even my first cigar experience! We also had various fun conversations regarding everything from how to live as a 20 something to dating in San Francisco. She also had a variety of interesting, original answers, from her experiences building labs in Tanzania and shcking oysters in New York, to her ideas and images on the siginificant people in her life. Thanks Aspen for everything, and next time I'll definitely go see you sing!!<br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This is my wonderful apartment, and  I wanted do it here because the moment I got this place is the moment I really felt like I was established in SF. Before I had a job, and I had been in the Bay area, but I didn’t feel like I had a place of my own. But now I have this!! And its hard to get a place thats your own in San Francisco!! haha </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 Does it have to be a city??
<br><br>
>>No its a free month where you could do anything! 
<br><br>
Ok. I think I’d like to go…hmm…somewhere a little rural, by the water, maybe somewhere in South East Asia? I want to be somewhere that is slower…where being  outside is part of everyday life. Somewhere things are simpler. I like the idea of that.
So I don’t know if I have anything specific, but I’ll say…Sri Lanka! haha So yeah, somewhere where its easy to be outside. 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Other than my own…this is going to sound kind of trite, but I spent two and a half weeks in Tanzania when I was 16 or 17, and I was installing computer labs in schools there. Well, “a” computer lab, in “a” school to be honest haha. I had been to Ghana before, doing the same thing. But there was something about Tanzania, it was the people I met and the circumstances, that made me feel really at home, and welcomed, even though I didn’t feel like they were my people, and this was my place. It was a really nice and easy place to be with a lot of mutual interest and, um, yeah there’s always something cool about being back in the motherland too haha. I can’t ignore that! But its like as you said Leo, when you’re in Japan, you’re half white, half American. When I’m in Africa, I’m white! They’re not like “welcome home sister!”, they’re like “You’re a white girl” but that’s ok haha. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow that’s really interesting. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/aspen/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Thing that represents my life in SF?? Oh San Francisco in general…hmm…right now at this moment, I would say “change” best represents San Francisco. All this conflict between people who have been here forever, and people who just got here. You know, as a person who is just coming in as part of this millennial flood, I want to be respectful to the people who’ve had generations and generations of family here. But I also want to enjoy the things that millennials are bringing in, like great restaurants and beautiful apartments.  This flux is something I’m really feeling strongly right now. <br><br>
    And for place…I’ve got to say the Castro. Its so known for the freedom and ability to be openly gay here, and that part of the city is a wonderful representation of that. Even Seattle (Aspen’s hometown) is a liberal city, but you wouldn’t see a gay couple at a cafe just embracing like you’d see a straight couple there, but here, its just so normal, and that’s so cool. Its also just really fun. No one hits on you when you’re a girl when you’re out there haha (Leo explodes with laughter). You can just dance! Sometimes its nice to feel like you’re invisible.
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   Gosh…I don’t know if I would. Hmm…I get the stripes, I get what they represent, but I think I would ditch them and just keep the stars. Stars are beautiful and there’s one for each state…but I don’t know though. Its just such a big…its so hard to  imagine anything different! Its just is what it is. </p>
<br>

<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
 —The Ocean <br>
I see Orca whales in the San Juan islands. That’s what I see, even though the San Juan islands aren’t actually open ocean.  
<br><br>
—The Sun <br>
Hmmm….sunrise. Sunrise over a hill. I don’t know why. Although I’m from Seattle so I don’t have much association with the sun haha.
<br><br>
>>> Haha. I fully concur, being from Portland. 
<br><br>
—Death <br>
Um, so recently I got super spiritual in like a fruit loopy way, and someone recently described death to me, or at least their concept of death. It was described as “slipping into a warm bath”, so that’s what I see. Instead of being this immediate cut off, immediate change, I see it as something that is soothing, comfortable, relief. 
<br><br>
>>> Is this the moment you’re about to die, or just death in general? 
<br><br>
Yeah, the moment you’re about to die. This wasn’t from someone who had actually had a near death experience so I don’t know where it came from, but I though it was nice.  

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 I feel like the future is something that…hmm…I don’t feel it as something that really exists. I feel that its something we create as we go along…they say that humans are the only animals that can imagine situations that they aren’t actually in. And the mind has this incredible ability to create alternate realities, so the future is just one of the alternate realities that you can imagine yourself in. Its not a real thing. So…I don’t know. I guess I’m always trying to imagine the best future for me, so things work out, and my alternate reality is something that I really want it to be. <br>
      And for mankind and the world…um…I feel like…well I feel like this is really presumptuous but I feel like we will all end up where we want to go. And I don’t really mean that on a individual level, but more in a grand scheme…I think we’ll get where we want to be.   
<br><br>
>>>which is…???
<br><br>
Well people talk a lot about…you know, more harmony and peace, which is such a trite word but, more understanding and more compassion, not just towards other people but the planet. So yeah, I don’t think we’re doomed towards this world of wars and hatred or anything. 

</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
My family, that counts right? (Leo: of course!) Yeah, that’s definitely it. Especially now that I have a niece and a nephew. And I remember as a kid my aunts and uncles would come over and act so stoked about me, and I was like “who are you? you’re not even mom or dad, why are you so in to me? Its weird!“ haha. You know what I mean? “You’re not around all the time, I don’t know you that well” haha. But now that I’m an aunt, I go up to my niece and I’m like “kiss me on the lips!!” and she’s like “Why? That’s so dumb!” haha. And that has given me…well I’m sure that having your own children thing gives you a bigger feeling of that, but just watching these nuggets grow up, and change, and slowly becoming the people they’re becoming is really cool and important to me. 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Romantic partner? (Leo: Yes) I look for…um, what’s the word I’m looking for…I guess its “self reflection”. I think the only way you can really be close to anyone else is if you know yourself really well, and you can identify where you’re holding back, where you’re uncomfortable, and where you <I>are</i> comfortable…where you can give, where you can work on that and change it if you want to, or accept it if you want to. Um, I think that’s really the only way you can be emotionally intimate with someone else, and its hard. Its a hard thing to do, and to be, and to find. That’s the most important thing for me.

<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Married: I do!! I DO…but its this horrible…I don’t know. To be a woman in this country, and maybe in any country, there is so much pressure to get married…to not be a cat lady. (haha)  And i come from a family where marriages don’t last, so I know for a fact that you could get married and still be a cat lady but, I do want to get married. 
<br><br>
Children: Yes
<br><br>
Original Question:<br>
Hmm… what do you mean by “do with them”?
<br><br>
>>>Well once they’ve grown a little older or even when they’re adults, is there something you’d like to do with them because they are your children?? 
<br><br>
I think I want to…I want to do right by them, even though I know that’s hard. That’s something I’ve seen parents do, and not do. So what I want to do with them is challenge them, even though thats hard for me. (Silence) And I want to take them to the pool too haha. And give them ice cream!! 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) So when they challenge you back you give them in the ice cream, 
<br><br>
And when they’re being jerks, I throw them in the pool! Haha
<br><br>
>>>So how do you want them to grow up?? 
<br><br>
I want to….I want them to grow up well exposed. I want them to see different things and meet different people, and I want them to be able to self modulate. I don’t want them to rely on external circumstances to feel ok.

<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
The first thing I want to see is a dog licking my face! That would be the best thing ever. I love that! 
<br><br>
>>>Is there a type of dog?
<br><br>
Well so this dream of mine is to have this really tiny white fluffy Maltypoo (Maltese/Poodle) or something and name him Greg, so I’d have him wake me up. Everyday in high school my mom would let our Yorkie in my room two minutes before my alarm would go off, and I that was my favourite way to wake up. <br>
    And the last thing before I go to sleep? Candle light. Which is why I have all these candles. 
 </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
So ok. I remember the happiest moment very clearly.  I was in the back of this gypsy cab in NYC, and I was coming home from my job as an oyster shucker at a dive bar on the lower east side. It was 4:45 in the morning, and the gypsy cab driver had stopped to get some tea. He asked me if I wanted some tea, and I said “yes”, he asked me if I wanted some cookies and I said “Yes”, and he asked me if I wanted some sticky rice and I was like “YEAH”. So he parked his cab, which was just a van without windows, an unmarked van, and his name was David, but he was fully Chinese so I don’t think it was his real name. Anyway, he came back with Lipton tea and cream, cookies, and a thing of sticky rice, and drove me back home. And, I had come from this job that I loved, which was just so weird, and the people…well it was just the weirdest circumstance and I just remember myself feeling, “This is the happiest I have ever been“. 
 <br><br>

And the most terrifying moment was…well my dad had cancer, and I went home to stay with him through his first course of chemotherapy. And he’s SUPER macho so he would never let me drive home, so we’re in the car, him driving, when he started throwing up. And we weren’t on the freeway or anything so it wasn’t like our lives were in danger, but it was the first time I had seen him really vulnerable, really sick. And um…well I started yelling at him, because I was really mad. That was my initial reaction, that he wouldn’t let me drive home. But underneath everything, I was really scared. </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Ok. So my childhood dream was to go to Harvard and play soccer. Then go to Harvard law and become a lawyer. And what would I say to her now? I’d say “You’re dumb” (laughs) “That’s not what you want! That’s what you’re dad says you want!” 
   And my dream now is, well it probably should have been my childhood dream but, I want to be singer. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s interesting. Its usually the opposite! 
<br><br>
Yeah, I flipped it! Haha
<br><br>
>>>Most people want to become a singer but then become a lawyer haha
<br><br>
Yeah. I went from “I want to be a lawyer!!” to “I want to be a jazz singer!!” Haha.
