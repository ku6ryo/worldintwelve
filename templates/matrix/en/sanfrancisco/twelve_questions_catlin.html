    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：27　Years in San Francisco：20 (Including Bay Area) <br>
     <br> 
 Catlin was introduced to me through Professor Goto at San Francisco State University. Catlin is one of those types that have "charismatic" written all over them. Catlin is an actor, dancer, and world traveller, having done her acting and dancing (and just plain living her awesome life) in various Asian countries. Catiln was so nice in that, not only did she show me around San Francisco by visiting art schools and hole-in-the-wall doughnut shops, on a later day, she fave me a tour or both Berkeley and Oakland too. Her answers to the questions are really unique, and truly depict her one-of-a-kind nature. I recommend her close country (Q.2), her images (Q.5), her "thing" (Q.7), and her moments (Q.11), but really, they are all very, very good answers. So Catlin, I wil see you again, maybe when you do another performance in another exotic country!!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
     We’re shooting at the Subterranean Art House, what is now called, the Subterranean Art Collective.  We’re going through a huge transition here and I’m a big part of that transition.  When I left San Francisco six years ago, it was because of the woman who founded the Subterranean Art House and she sent me on a journey with Performance Art in Asia.  She kind of started the location; she curated the beginning of my journey.  She invited me at that time, to come back and perform in this space, which is so exciting…it’s so exciting that it’s still going that she’s kept it going successfully for six years.  And is now opening this space to community organizations, which is a really an exciting thing. </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 (Deep Breath) If I was handed $2500 (thinking) I would… right now, in this time, after coming back from traveling around the world and keeping a focus on performing arts, I would probably go to Bogota.  I would go to Bogota and I would go during the time when they have their bi-annual theater festival.  They have a street theater festival there.  I’ve heard incredible things about Bogota and also the performing arts developing in South America.  And it… Bogota came up in a list of cities that had surprisingly high numbers of theater seats per capita, in the world.  And I had no idea that Bogota had, well and Columbia had such a thriving performing arts scene, I had no idea.  And that’s what attracts me the most because it defied my expectation.  It was one of the reasons… it’s been the reason that I stayed in certain cities, it’s that they surprise me.  So hearing that fact, I would really want to go experience that.
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 That’s such a good question…  Currently, I would say I feel the closest to… Nepal.  I was living in China for a number of years, and before that I was traveling mainly in Southeast Asia after I left San Francisco.  
When I arrived in Nepal, it was almost like everything unified.  All of this work that I had been doing sort of came together and there were some beautiful small, and it, it felt really small and accessible opportunities there because the country is… the country is really quite small.  And the people, the culture there is very open to family building, the language is intrinsically familial, so when you try to speak with people it’s always brother and sister and uncle and auntie.  When you speak with that language, people respond from… with a really deep appreciation from the heart and that was something that I really enjoyed.  <br><br>
I also loved seeing all of these points of pilgrimage that were not only for Hindu people, not only for Buddhist people, they were for everyone. And people came together from very different, very traditional backgrounds and there was no… no problem.  There were absolutely no problems getting along.  In fact, a lot of the people accepted the Gods as their own, even if they had a different form.  There wasn’t rejection; there was a lot of incorporation and respect, so I thought that was really interesting in Nepal.  And I thought that was a beautiful global model, that we can share this space, even if there is not a lot of space, we can share this space, it’s really possible.<br><br>
>>>Yeah, being it’s right between India and China.<br><br>
Yes. (laughs)
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/catlin/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Hmmm…what one thing represents the Bay area the best?  You know, at the moment, and again this is very much in the moment, I would say the Bay Bridge right now.  Because we have the remnants of the old Bay Bridge that represented so much for so many people, including the ’89 earthquake where part of it fell down, including the progress and experimentation that a lot of people see in the Bay area incorporating all kinds of new technologies.  <br><br>
We have our suspension bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, and then we had this double decker, crazy, terrifying Bay Bridge that a lot of people really needed to commute with every day.  And there’s… it, it represents us in so many different ways, the divide between Oakland and Berkeley and San Francisco.  Not only with the air… the air quality, the income ratio… there’s so many things that that bridge represents… and commerce, so…
<br><br>
 Yeah.  So the Bay Bridge, also that the old Bay Bridge is still standing and being slowly taken down and the new Bay Bridge is, half of it is so sparkly and new and half of it tries to maintain some… structural architectural nod to what was there before.  Which I think is a really nice thing and it represents what’s really happening here, which is a huge shift There’s so much change happening in the Bay area right now, with all of this new money coming in from technology.  And a good half of that is not paying any attention to the…well, what has been in San Francisco before.  The bridge is halfway brand new and halfway a nod to what was before, so I think that’s good representation.<br><br>
>>>OK, great.  So I guess that would be both thing and place.<br><br>
Yeah.  Absolutely, absolutely. 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Right, I don’t have to.  How would I do it, it’s if, if I were to redesign the flag... (thinking)  That’s a really good question… (thinking)… (laughs)  There are so many different things that are represented by the United States..  I do find our flag to be a little bland compared to what our country represents.  Maybe I would try to incorporate the geography of the country into the flag’s design… more than just having a bunch of different stars.  <br><br>
Although, I have to say that, in a sense as far as our government structure goes, our flag makes quite a lot of sense, because there’s both geographical representation, but it’s more population based, in an effort to keep us all kind of equal in some sense or other.  <br><br>
But… there’s something kind of holding us together at the seams and I would love to see something that showed the way that we unite more, that there’s some kind of tension, instead of all these tight cookie cutter lines.  I’d like to little bit more curve going on in the flag’s design (laughs) And maybe a shape change.  Nepal’s got a really great shape of their flag, so I think we should, you know,  jump on that train and change the shape of the flag, it doesn’t always have to be a rectangle.  (laughs)  </p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/catlin/3.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
Womb… Mother.<br><br>
>>>That makes sense.<br><br>
Yeah and there’s a rhythm in the ocean and a mystery to the ocean that is sort of complex.  It’s this sort of darker energy in the planet that we don’t always…we haven’t had the technology to explore, so it’s this kind of darkness, and of course wetness.  I always think of the PH balance in the ocean is the same as the mother’s womb.  So…<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
 The sun…  Confidence.  Confidence… and I see something of struggle with the sun in, with, sometimes I think about the sun because I, I’m also a yoga teacher, and we talk about the sun cycles being the most important time of day to practice and it’s also when we go to bed and when we wake up.  But cities have changed that so dramatically, but there’s this sort of… struggle with the sun.  (laughs)<br><br>
>>>Interesting.<br><br>
That’s very different images and words, but there’s a struggle for confidence with the sun.  Struggling confidence.  (laughs) <br><br>
—Death<br>
Death…  The space between breaths.<br><br>
>>>…can you elaborate a little? <br><br>
The space between breaths, what’s happening there… when you’re not breathing in and you’re not breathing out.  There’s this transition period that happens.
>>> Wow, that’s pretty cool. <br><br>
Maybe I think of death more as a transition, than a state of being… it’s and a mystery as well.
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
  I think of the future… sometimes I kind of laugh when I think about the future because I realize how unpredictable it really is.  But we have to plan for it and that’s the way that people talk to each other is with these future plans, it’s very calming to try and think that there might be something we can control in the future, but somehow within me I’m always laughing about it, because I know that we don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, at all.  And traveling makes you realize that, I think in a huge way as well, because whatever grand plans you may have, the world has something else to offer you.  So I try to leave myself open actually, because I think that… I mean I try to plan a lot of things for my future and I really want to, but I know also that sometimes… you’ll hear something, you’ll hear something in the wind or you’ll hear something from an unexpected place or a disappointment or a closed door might lead you to something you never thought would exist. Which is one of the reasons why I ended up living in China for three years, without ever thinking that I would be there.   I could never have imagined that that’s what I would have done, but… that was my reality for a long time, so…future, imagination… projection…

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Thing.  To do stuff, action.  I don’t know if that’s a…<br><br>
>>>  That works.<br><br>
Action, the doing.  I’m an… I’m an actress and I think a lot of people maybe who might be in performing arts also or who might consider themselves actors or actresses sometimes forget that to act literally means to do, to be active. And when I see people who are successful on stage both as a director, as an actor, as a dancer; when people are doing something, it doesn’t necessarily matter what the thing is that they’re doing, even if they apply it to a story, how they apply it…<br><br>  
But as long as they’re doing something, they are doing something specific; they have made the choice to do that thing, in the space, at that time, for whatever reason.  I think that’s really interesting and it’s important to keep doing things, because as ridiculous as the future might be, in the present if we do things it gives us some meaning… which is really important, I think. <br><br> 
It’s very important to do things and to feel a part of that doing with people.  It’s some kind of process, it could be anything, but as long as you’ve made that choice to do it and there’s something in a follow through also that’s very comforting… but doing, action, movement.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 A working partner or a romantic partner?<br><br>
>>>  Romantic.  It could be whatever your preference… (laughs)<br><br>
Right. (laughs) I’m pretty hetero, but I’m open to a lot of things.  I think when I… what I look for in a partner is someone who… who can see or who holds some similar ideals maybe, and in what they do.  Whether it’s a rehearsal that they feel like you should show up on time or you should be doing… you should be doing art that you have some integrity for, you have some passion for with your time.  For me, a nine to five job and a regular income has never been important, at all, about someone that I’m interested in.  Nor, I do not have a type.  I cannot say I have a type.  The people that I’ve been with have been very different people from very different backgrounds.  Most of them have a deep involvement with the community where they’re from, on some level and have taken a lot of action to make that a part of their life…  I think it’s yeah, I think that’s important.  (laughs)

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
I don’t see that happening for myself.<br><br>
Children: Undecided <br><br>
  I don’t see a marriage in my future.  Having lived in a lot of different cultures, and actually having dated people from a lot of different countries and in their home country, where cultures are so different from American culture and expectation from a partner is so… strong, actually and very deeply ingrained in a lot of different cultures.  <br><br>
In America we’re trained it’s equal; girls are the same as boys.   For a lot of, in a lot of my experience with relationships, I was always… I always had that in my mind, that we are equal, as a matter of fact.  But then having lived in some different cultures and different situations, I can recognize and I think we can all recognize as kids, that boys and girls are not exactly the same. That we have a lot of different strengths and weaknesses, and that’s fine.  It doesn’t mean that we’re greater or lesser than each other.  <br><br>
But when I see a lot of expectations that I hear people talking about just saying “I need to have a house” for example, “I need to have a car” “I need to be beautiful” “I should be an 8” or “I should be a 9” or “I should be a 10” or all of these kinds of standards that I hear people talking about, it sounds so ridiculous to me.  I can’t relate, I don’t relate to that kind of…<br><br>
>>> Marriage as something that has to be in life, that everybody does. Basically that doesn’t apply.<br><br>
Yeah, I don’t see that. <br><br>
>>> But you do want children though?<br><br>
Right.  This is a really good question, do I want children.  I think that children, to have children right now, right now, is a selfish thing, would be a selfish thing.  I would have a child just to see a little pro-generate of myself.  There, the truth of the matter… the truth of the matter is that there’s a huge population thing happening on this planet and we all know it’s over populated.  <br><br>
In the United States, we don’t see it as much, but having lived in China on and off for about five years and also traveling in and out of India for the last two years about… population is so real to me.  It’s a little bit suffocating and it’s scary for me to think about bringing yet another person into the picture.  That being said, I think life is stronger than my imagination or my philosophy about population on the planet and sometimes it springs forth. (laughs) So, I… I would love to support that and I know that in my life, my child would’ve become the most important thing, that’s why we’re here, sort of.<br><br>
>>>Interesting…<br><br>
Yeah, but I can’t imagine bringing another one in.  (laughs)



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
(Thinking)…That’s interesting.  The ideal thing for me to see when I wake up is sunrise… and some kind of natural scene actually.  Having lived in cities and also having grown up in the Monterey Peninsula, which is really beautiful, aesthetically, that’s become a big priority in my life, having nature, I find it very calming.  And I like to wake up and do yoga, so… sunrise is a really good time for that.<br><br>
>>>Alright and before you go to sleep?<br><br>
Before I go to sleep…  It’s funny because it kind of… I would love to see a really happy, smiling face.  Maybe I’d love to see a family, oh my gosh.  (laughs)  Uh-oh, that’s a different idea!!  But just generally, maybe friends, even, because I spend a lot of time with them…  But people, community, smiles. <br><br>
>>> Everybody smiling when you go to bed.<br><br>
Yeah, maybe I think of it almost like meditation.  That would be great to just see people… satisfied with their day and…<br><br>
>>>And then you close your eyes.<br><br>
  Yeah, and then I close my eyes.<br><br>
 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/catlin/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 (Thinking) It’s probably also relative to the time that I was in my life.  But, when I think about it sitting here right now, probably the happiest moment in my life was… when I was flying from the southwest of China at nine o’clock in the morning over the Himalayan mountain range into Katmandu.  It was a big transition for me in my life and… it felt so right, it felt so easy… Everything seemed to line up and then I saw Mount Everest, which was one of my biggest dreams in my life and I flew right over it as an introduction to Nepal.  I flew right over the entire range and seeing the mountains and the clouds on the same level, and sometimes a mountain and sometimes a cloud was so inspiring, it was so inspiring, and elating and just, that was a dream and it was happening!  Yeah, that was a really happy moment. <br><br>
>>>Alright and so what was the most frightening or terrifying moment?<br><br>
Probably one of the more terrifying moments I’ve had in my life was…um… I felt so stifled in a situation I was in, actually in, Bejing, the city area.  I don’t want to say anything bad about Bejing, because Bejing is amazing.  It has beautiful nature, it has so many things.  But, also again, with population, there’s very, there aren’t very many places where you can go and feel like “Oh, I’m alone here” or, somehow feeling that way.  I’m used to having nature or I’m used to having a park or a corner where you can sit and… there was one evening in particular in Bejing where I decided to walk to a friend’s home because I just wanted to see my friend. And I realized through this walk, and I was walking underneath a huge bridge that only cars went underneath; because I was thinking directionally “OK my friend’s house is north, I’ll just walk”.  I ended up going through a HUGE freeway, walking along… this was my neighborhood, which I hadn’t really thought about walking around for more than a mile in.  There were… it was, it was terrifying.  I couldn’t get out of it…<br><br>
>>>  Were you surrounded by fast cars?<br><br>
 I was surrounded by cars… it was later at night, so there weren’t so many fast cars, but there were cars coming here and there.  There were probably four different huge roads connecting right there, plus a subway system.  And just looking around and realizing I… this is not really my place, I’m a little bit overwhelmed, and there is not <i>even dirt</i> anywhere near me.  I don’t know where I am and I don’t know what  I’m doing here.  That was a terrifying, terrifying moment and… there was no way out of it, I mean there was no way out of it.  Looking around, unless I was just to walk my way out of it, no one… no one there I really knew that well.  Getting lost… getting lost on the freeway in Bejing was really scary. (laughs) 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
 I had several childhood dreams; probably the one that I latched onto pretty strongly was the dream of being an Egyptologist.  I really wanted to dig around in the pyramids.  When I was a kid there was this excavation of the Valley of the Kings and I thought that was just about the coolest thing I’d ever heard of, to dig up all of these ancient Kings, and all of this scary mythology that was coming out about curses that were left on people and the dangers and perils of these adventurers who would go in and see what was happening inside.  That was a huge dream of mine as a kid, to be able to study the language and understand all of these different hieroglyphics, and mostly to dig and discover something that had once been.  <br><br>
Big dream… I think I could tell myself to study anthropology in university next time.  (laughs)  Keep on the anthropology kick, but also in a lot of ways I’m still going for it, sort of.  Cultural preservation? In a lot of ways by pursuing performing arts and trying to pursue stories that… or trying to uncover stories that are super relevant that people haven’t necessarily heard before.  Something that’s relevant to the audience, that is something I’m searching for, is what is relevant to the audience, where I am…  Everyone finds who, a new person interesting.  <br><br>
I was recently reading a book by Ann Bogaurd, who does View Points, a really interesting director, wonderful, strong, tour de force, New York City lady and she said “The thing about theater is that you go somewhere to meet someone”.  That’s really what it’s all about.  And that is something that’s very interesting.  Humans love to meet another one… fascinated in meeting another one, right?  That’s exactly what you’re doing now.  So in a sense maybe my obsession with Egypt was trying to meet these other people in the world that I have no idea about.  And…I’m still doing that, I’m still on that journey. <br><br>
>>> Alright, and then your dream now?<br><br>
To facilitate… to facilitate community… to facilitate communication in communities…and I think art is a really wonderful way of doing that because it, art and mythology, are these really interesting tools that we have to communicate and I think it’s really important to try and have a little bit of compassion for all of these people that live in this, on this ball (laughs)… our ball!  There’s a lot of interest… having traveled a lot, I find that people know more about America than I do, in a lot of ways because people have access to our media, people have access to our culture, and they think it’s really interesting… but I’m interested in the other!
