    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：25　Years in San Francisco：Originally from the Bay area, been on/off <br>
     <br>Denisha was introduced to me through Nana, who she was with at USC and their stay in Jakarta. A world traveller, it seems Denisha has been to a bunch of amazing places...and frankly, I'm jealous. We met up a couple times during my stay in San Francisco, and she even showed me around her company, which was really cool. She is lone standing when it comes to answering the questions with humor, and the whole experience was a so much fun, especially next to the ocean, with the sun setting. Check out her views on death (Q.4), a good partner (Q.8) and if you're into deep answers, well her most terrifying and happiest moment (Q.11) was shocking. Thanks for everything Denisha, and I'd love to meet you in Japan, or even during one of your adventures elsewhere!! </p><br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: So this is the cupid’s bow and arrow right here, and I live about 10 minutes away walking distance I would say. I always jog up and down the Embarcadero…I don’t know, its a nice view of the city, its outdoors, its not in my office haha </p>
    <br>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 Does it have to be one place? 
<br><br>
>>>No it could be many places, as long as its in a month. 
<br><br>
Oh ok, I would go through South America. I would go to Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil…I haven’t been to those places. I love the culture of South America, the pace of life, and I think that’s enough money to have a good time. As opposed to some place like Europe where I’d blow it all the first week haha.  
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 (Silence) That’s a tough question. Ok…probably…there are two countries that come to mind first. One is Chile, which I lived in for half a year, and the other, as out there as its sounds, would be Indonesia. I lived there only two months but something about the spirit there just really stood out, and as different as the culture is, I still felt very welcome. I don’t know, I’ve never felt that welcome even in a place such as Canada, or even any city in the United States. Something…it just has a spirit to it that like.
<br><br>
>>>Can you define the spirit?
<br><br>
Everyone’s happy, everyone is willing to help you, everyone is smiling all the time. I don’t know if its the creepy smiles, or like something else, maybe they’re making fun of me being a white girl, but its just a place where I constantly felt a strong level of happiness. 
</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Like a place In the city? And a thing? Hmmm…maybe kale?? Haha 
<br><br>
>>>Haha I like it!!
<br><br>
No, I mean food is huge, so the first things that are coming to my mind are Bi Rite, which is an ice cream parlor and, um, probably Dolores Park. That’s a good one.  There’s a lot of good restaurants around there, and that’s where the whole park culture—where people just go to parks and hang out all day—that’s the go to, for people here. A lot of hippies and…yeah, its fun!! 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   (Laughs) Um, I don’t know, something about stripes too much like a border? If you know what I mean. Everything just looks divided…and each state has its own little star. I mean, they all have their own personality right? But…this is a tough question! I don’t know, maybe I’d just make it all tie-dye or something haha. 
<br><br>
>>>Haha. So it fits in with Dolores Park!! That’s really cool. 
<br><br>
Yeah, maybe tie-dye red white and blue!! More mixed!!  </p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/denisha/3.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
 —The Ocean (which we’re right next to)<br>
An image? Like, the first thing that pops into my head?? Ok…surfing! haha Its the first thing I thought of. 
<br><br>
—The Sun <br>
…the beach. Yeah.   
<br><br>
>>>San Francisco beach?
<br><br>
No, I’m imagining Hawaii beach. Palm trees…yeah. Sand…big green mountains in the background. And the water is blue. 
<br><br>
—Death <br>
Oh, Ok haha. Oh man…I don’t know…part of me wants to say cubicle haha
<br><br>
>>>Hahahaha OH NO!!!!!
<br><br>
Just turn the camera around! All this!! No I’m just kidding…I mean, you gotta do it right? The grind, the daily grind, the 9 to 5, whatever. Um, yeah, anything confining…cubicle. Jail. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 I don’t look forward to getting older, but I’m not intimidated by the future anymore. I used to be, when I was little, but…its like…people…I don’t know, I just feel good about it, because I just feel so much better about the world and myself now then I did last year or the before. You get older, and you learn how to control yourself and your approach, feelings, and other stuff, optimism. <br>
   And for the world…I don’t…I mean, there is nothing in life that I take to heart that is too threatening. Everyone talks about Apocalypse, this and that, you know, global warming, the plant that exploded in Japan. So there’s all those things, but those kind of things have been happening since the last, I don’t know, throughout man kind. This…is a very philosophical question haha. (Pause) Mankind has been creating problems and what does that do? It gives another group an opportunity to solve them. Its a cycle. <br>
   I have those days where I think everything sucks, and there is no point in doing anything, but that’s the good thing about getting older. Its that you start to figure out how to overcome those doubtful days. 
<br><br>
>>>We’re all growing up huh

</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/denisha/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>

Friends. I think its friends, community, and a sense of purpose. And you can intertwine love and all that stuff but um, I think everything…I mean, what are you going to enjoy in life if you have no one to enjoy it with? What are you going to enjoy…(phone rings)…hold a minute…silence that!!! haha <br>
   And sense of purpose…if you don’t have a structure or sense of something that tells you what to fulfil, you’re just going to be doing stuff, but what is that fulfilling? Its nice to feel like you accomplished something for a reason, not just you accomplished something…blank. And I feel that community helps build that structure. 

</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Um…six pack abs…haha I’m just kidding! No, lets see…someone…someone that can push me…someone that can inspire me, and is willing to push me in certain directions, which is better for myself? I don’t know…that sounds so cliche. 
<br><br>
>>>Hey if its true.
<br><br>
I should just say a trust fund haha. But…that’d be nice. No but someone who is better than me, has a higher level of intellect. In particular, that’s something that I look for. Specifically that.
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/denisha/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
    Marry: Yes. Children: YES!!<br>
I want them to see the world, and I want them to…I want them to discover their purpose, and…I don’t want them to be lost. And if their purpose is to play piano, or their purpose is to, like, be a chef or something, that’s great! You know, I just want them to be fulfilled and on a path where they can find that for themselves. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything you want to do with them, other than show them the world?? 
<br><br>
What do you mean??
<br><br>
>>>Like…bake cookies?? 
<br><br>
Of course!! I’d like to cook with them all the time!! Play sports…wait, this foot is asleep haha. Anyway, yeah, the usual stuff. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
Uuummmm, someone I’m in love with, to answer both of those. 
<br><br>
>>>Lets just leave it at that…we don’t need an explanation. 

 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/denisha/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
(Thinking) Um…the happiest moment of my life?? …(Silence)…this is tough…so you know, that changes over time yeah? 
<br><br>
>>>Of course. 
<br><br>
So…this is going to get really deep, really quick. Is that ok? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I’ve had a few deep answers…
<br><br>
So I was in Thailand over my 23rd birthday. And I went out that night. Ended up…well, I had an encounter…basically I was almost killed by this guy. I walked on the beach with him, we met at a bar, the night of my birthday, and he…he raped me and beat the shit out or me. And I ended up in a hospital in southern Thailand for the next three days…I was with two of my friends, Nana was one of them, and um, I mean I was in a hospital. I had a concussion, I had needles stuck in me. Nurses who didn’t speak English coming in and giving me medicine. I just had no idea…I mean, I’m in a foreign country. I’m in a public hospital in a third world country. We had no idea what to do, what was going on. So…to confine the worst and best times of my life, well that whole experience was the worst time of my life. But overcoming that, and getting test results back―because I was tested for all these diseases, all different kinds of stuff―and just getting out of the hospital ok, learning that it was all…that I made it fine…(deep breath)…once that it was all over, that was the happiest time. Which was a few different steps, but…yeah, when that kind of thing happens to you, and you’re waiting for HIV and AIDS test results to come back for a week, that’s the worst week of your life. And when it finally comes back, you’re fine, and you’re like, “Holy shit, I’m ok”/
<br><br>
>>>Wow…that probably was the deepest one so far… </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream? I had so many of them…some of them were to become really rich, and some of them were to be able to travel as much as I wanted. One specific one was to become a professional basketball player, but that didn’t happen. But, the one thing that I would tell my self is…well…just to be confident. Like, always. Be a good person, be grateful for what you have, but be confident, there’s no reason to beat yourself up for not meeting a random expectation, for example. I don’t know, you learn that you are your hardest judge, so give compliments, if you really want something, its totally possible. I really believe that. 
<br><br>
>>>And what is your dream now??
<br><br>
(Laughs)…Its…its kind of still the same! I want to travel, its kind of want to…its hard to really give it a specific structure but, I want to be some sort of public figure that travels and teaches people about whatever…but I don’t want to be one of those wishy-washy speakers, you know what I’m talking about?
<br><br>
>>>I can think of a word but I don’t want to say it haha. Who knows who’s reading this?
<br><br>
Haha, oh yeah, ok, so maybe my dream is to travel the world and review breakfast buffets, how about that!?
<br><br>
>>>Hahahaha that’s great!! Let’s leave it at that!!
