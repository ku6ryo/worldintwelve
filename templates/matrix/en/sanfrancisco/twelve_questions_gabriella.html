    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：Fresh 28　Years in San Francisco：20 <br>
     <br> Gabriella was introduced to me when I was with Lance, doing his 12 Questions. Gabriella, a fashion designer, brought some of her work for a shoot. When I got to meet Gabriella for her own 12 Questions, she invited me to her home/atelier. Her flat was one of the coolest and conziest homes I've ever been to (I wish I could put up more pictures...maybe later on pinterest or something), and Gabriella herself is one of the most charming, fun, and electrifying people I've met. I mean, just look at her on top of her rooftop!! That one pic basically explains everything. Her answers to the questions truly reflect her personality and ideas too. For the quick read, I recommend her images (Q.5), her thing (Q.7), wake up/go to sleep (Q.10) and her moments (Q.11). I am so looking forward to doing stuff with Gabriella in the future. Heaven on earth!!   <br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  This is my studio. I call it my atelier. It is my fashion studio with my art studio. It's just my little nook like you'd call a man cave for a guy, this is my girl cave and it's ever-changing and going through transformations all the time. Right now it's mainly black furniture and used to be white so this is kind of left over but I still kind of really like these pieces.   </p>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/gabriella/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  I would go to Australia. That's been on my plate - on my mind - for a long time and I'd love to go work there and live there for a while but if I could go on vacation for a month, that would make me happy. I love the fashion industry out there right now. Most of my favorite fashion designers are there and I'm talking my top 20 favorites—they're all Australian. 
<br><br>
>>>Really? 
<br><br>
Yeah. They're just … I don't know what's going on over there but something right is happening and something really cool is going on. The music industry out there is great too. Oh and the weather. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there a specific city? 
<br><br>
I don't really know Australia so I haven't picked exactly where I would go. Maybe Sydney, I think that's where all the designers are from. But I think I would rather go somewhere smaller where it's not so popular, like a less popular city where there's not that many tourists; where I can just go explore and … do my thing. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 >>>This is kind of a difficult question for you because if I understand, you are originally from Brazil.
<br><br>
Yes. 
<br><br>
>>>And then you live in the U.S. So I'd say other than Brazil and the U.S.
<br><br>
 It's funny because I don't feel close to Brazil at all. 
<br><br>
>>>Okay, so that narrows it down haha 
<br><br>
Haha and I feel very close to America. I've tried to live in Brazil several times since I've been here and I can't do it. This last time I was there for 4 months and I went completely crazy. I have nothing in common with the people, the culture, the country in general. I am totally American. I'm actually an American citizen like 100%. Maybe 99% American. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Alright great! Actually I don't know if I'll use this but just in case, other than the U.S. is there any country you feel close to?
<br><br>
Right. I loved Italy. I went to Italy a couple years ago and I loved everyone there. I loved the buildings, the architecture, the food…just life. Everyone is so happy. It's such a nice, simple life even though it's expensive. Italy better than France for sure so…I really loved Italy. 
</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/gabriella/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Hmm…Golden Gate. 
<br><br>
>>>For the thing. 
<br><br>
Thing. 
<br><br>
>>>The bridge are you saying? 
<br><br>
Yeah the Golden Gate… bridge. (Laughs) The Golden Gate bridge!! Yeah, there's something about it. It's the one thing - like I've recently started to fall out of love with San Francisco and I think just because I've been here for so long and I'm just yearning to discover other places. But I'm very grateful for San Francisco and everything it's provided me from inspiration to friends to homes and all that. So I've had a great time here…but every time I see the Golden Gate, something in my heart beats a little faster. There's a little spark there when I see the Golden Gate, every time. We just went up on my roof and…I just love that thing! Just something about it. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>So I guess it's both the thing and the place. 
<br><br>
And the place!
    <p>

    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  I'd make it black and white…(thinks)…just because colors are too, I don't know, red white and blue? It's funny because it doesn't really ring America to me? I mean, I know that's like the saying, red white and blue, American flag, whatever. But I would make it black and white. I don't know why. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Same stars and stripes? 
<br><br>
Same! Yeah I like the flag. 
<br><br>
>>>Just black and white. 
<br><br>
Black and white. 
<br><br>
>>>Great. That's pretty cool. I don't think there's a single flag that's black and white. It would stand out.
<br><br>
 It would be cool. Black and white stripes.  </p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/gabriella/3.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean…I love… I admire, I respect, I fear… I crave… 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
I…um…Cancer? (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Cancer!! (Laughs) 
<br><br>
Wrinkles…hahaha… tan lines. I used to love the sun. I'm not a sun girl anymore so I like the shade. 
<br><br>
>>>You like the shade. I like that. Although the shade wouldn't exist unless there was a sun. 
<br><br>
Unless there was a sun, yes. So I'm happy for people when they're in the sun and they love the sun. Like, cool you have fun over there. I'll be right here very comfortably. No fomo. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Um…I’ve been reading a lot about heaven on earth. 
<br><br>
>>>Is that a book? 
<br><br>
No, it's just a theory that heaven is on earth and you can make your heaven here. I mean… I was raised Catholic and you work your whole life here on earth to go to heaven later, but…just in case there isn't anything later, I'd like to make my heaven here now and then if there is something later then great. I'll enjoy that too but I really believe in being a good human and helping animals and ecology and other people and the world as much as you can. Do your part and do your best and be good and kind and… live to the fullest, be positive, be present. All those I really try to live by because I don't want to just waste away and…end up dying and not having anything. And if you live that way, and if there is a heaven after then you will go to heaven because you lived correctly. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
  The future…I’m not so sure it's going to be a great thing. Slowly people are becoming more conscious and aware of we have to change ourselves in order to have a better future so, like I said, I try to be positive and I want to think that everyone will come together and change our ways but there's been a lot of damage done already. I mean…war is imminent and it’s, ugh, a little bit dark for me but I try and stay present and be positive.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
(Thinking)… Independence is really important to me and I've been struggling with that because I have a great family who's really supportive so if ever I need them they're always there for me and friends. 
<br><br>
>>>And one excited dog haha (As she runs up to the camera)
<br><br>
(Laughs) And pets that love me! It's like, if ever I wore down or in need I would have a ton of people to call on. But I still want to get…there, to 100% independent from anyone…I don't know why. 
<br><br>
>>>This is interesting because you're living with your boyfriend.
<br><br>
Yeah. We are very independent though. Like we support each other and obviously we're there for each other but he has his music career that he works really hard at. I have my fashion career that I've working hard at. So we both have really independent lives. Together.  I call him my other whole, not my other half. 
<br><br>
>>>I like that…I like that one. I'll use that from now on. 
<br><br>
(Laughs) Right? Good, I love it! 
<br><br>
>>>Copyright it for you haha 
<br><br>
Good, pass that one on!! It's really important… Yeah my favorite poet, Khalil Gibran, do you know him? He says "drink from the same bottle of wine but drink from separate cups." So you can share…you don't have to share a cup with each other but you have the same kind of wine…I don’t know, I really believe in that. 
<br><br>
>>>That's actually a cool quote too. I'll look into that. 
<br><br>
I can give you a small book of his!! It's a "to-go" Khalil Gibran. That's how much I love him.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
I look for.. hmmm…(Thinking)…That's a tough question…Yeah it's kind of very specific. Obviously I look for that initial…connection? that you can't really explain with words. Where you're just connected to someone and that could be with friends or animals. Sometimes you just can't help the connection that happens. There's just literally an unspoken thing there…so that's the most important to me. There's like a deeper—I don't know what to call it! Because everything else in life you can kind of work through and you can kind of figure out. I've been with Chris for 4 years and we're still working through things and figuring things out and how to live in a balanced relationship and what to tweak to make it better. So that stuff I feel you can figure out with anyone. But if that deeper connection is not there, that thing you just can't explain? (Laughs)...That's what I'm drawn to. 
  </p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/gabriella/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: No.  I wouldn't need it. If I did, I think that would be fun but for the ceremony part, the party part. I think it'd be fun. I think it's great to celebrate love, but I don't think it's a great idea to…legally connect yourself with someone.
<br><br>
Children: No.  I think the world is overpopulated. I think I have too much on my plate and a lot of what's on my plate…is geared towards helping the world and changing the world and helping people and providing jobs and education for the world's future. So I do think I'm going to do my part in helping children at some point. That's my goal…so instead of having my own I just want to help the ones that are already here.

    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Smells are great. Coffee! (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>Haha Do you want to see coffee, or someone making coffee for you?? 
<br><br>
 Well…I just grew up, like my grandma would make coffee every morning so I woke up every day of my life to the smell of strong Brazilian coffee so that makes me happy. But I think maybe you should put a little plaque next to your bed that says like "Today is going to be awesome" or like "You're amazing" or something like cheesy but really cute to where you can wake up. (Laughs) And maybe if you're moody you can be like, “yeah you're right, Today is going to be amazing. You, plaque, you're right.” (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>You could do that now though. 
<br><br>
I try to do that in my own head but I think if you wake up and see something it would be way faster… because sometimes I wake up in a funk and it takes me a while to get out of it. So I think if I just woke up and saw that it would put me in a good mood immediately.
<br><br>
>>>And before you go to bed? 
<br><br>
Before I go to bed…(Thinking)… Maybe just something peaceful like the stars. I love the stars…What if you had like a see-through roof that was cleaned everyday by someone. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah you're right. Because you'll be looking at dust, not stars if you don't. Haha
<br><br>
True! Hahaha

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 I've had so many happy momenst…Happiest moment of my life… (Laughs) It's so hard. Happiest moment of my life…(Thinking)… I don't know, this is tough. I guess recently one of the happiest moments was…when I came back from Brazil this last time from living there and just realizing when I got here that I was in the right place. I've felt disconnected and like, I didn't belong in any specific place my entire life, which is why I've gone back and forth so many times. And this last time I came back to the United States, I felt like finally, I was doing the right thing. Like finally, I was in the right place. I felt like I didn't have to think about it anymore because I've been like "Am I Brazilian? Am I American?" my whole life I've had that struggle. And I thought I was Brazilian until I moved back 4 years ago, and then I got there and I was like "Oh shit, I'm not." So when I got here it was the first time I felt I was really at peace with my decision. That was a huge happy step….And I've been so happy every since. I've been so much happier. I've been a completely different person even. 
<br><br>
>>>Terrifying Moment?
<br><br>
Well I had a couple car accidents and a scooter accident that was really weird. (Laughs) I crushed my scooter the first time I took it out. It was really bad. I crashed it head on into an SUV. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>An SUV of all vehicles…
<br><br>
Oh my god. And I rolled over the hood and then landed on my feet. (Leo laughs in amazement)  I'm good, I'm good…but yeah. It was scary. I didn't know what I was doing, obviously it was my first time taking it out and…I had ridden scooters in Brazil since I was 12 but they're like little wimpy cheap scooters. This was like a nice, American, scooter. Not American, it was Italian but whatever.  It was an Aprilia. So we took it out, Chris was on his motorcycle behind me and I'm just like "do-do-do" on my scooter and then I went to make a turn and I didn't know you had to like, throw your body along with it. To me it was like a bicycle, you turn the wheel and it turns. I went straight into the other lane and I whiskey throttled instead of braking because that's what you do when you don't know what you're doing. Whiskey throttle!! (Bursts into laughter) Just, right into the middle of the car. And it was bad. I broke my wrist and messed up my knee…And yeah. I was in a car accident in Brazil too that was horrible. So both of those traumatized me.
<br><br>
>>>The one in Brazil sounds pretty bad. 
<br><br>
It was crazy. Can't go into that one, it's too bad. The scooter one is funny at least. 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to become a chemist. I wanted to be a scientist of any kind. I loved science…I still love science, and math…so its funny because I would tell my self, keep going for what you’re going for. Because what I ended up with was fashion design which was a lot of…math and science (laughs). And you know, like materials, you have to understand them, its kind of a science. Machines are kind of a science. So I did end up doing that in a way. 
<br><br>
My dream now…(thinking)…is to still be a fashion designer. To have my own company and…really what I want to do with my company is have my own manufacturing facilities in every country, where you can bring your kids, there will be a school so you can drop your kids off at the school. You can also go there to get educated on what you’re doing, on whatever you want. I just want it to be safe place where you can bring your family. Where you and your husband and your kids come to this compound, and you get educated, you get fed, and you work. You’re happy, you feel like you’re contributing to something, and you’re getting something back. I don’t want it to be some sweatshop where people are miserable…because even if its not sweatshop conditions, you’re still just sitting and sewing in this loud dirty place… 
<br><br>
>>>That sounds like sweatshop conditions…
<br><br>
Yeah, if you’ve ever been to a factory, its like hell. Even if you’re getting paid enough, the conditions are not fun…I want people who work for me to be…to feel like they’re not working for the man, that they are contributing to something good, that they are getting something back. So…that will be my gift to humanity instead of having kids (laughs).
<br><br>
>>>Awesome!! Heaven on earth!!  
 <br><br>
Yeah!!
