    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in San Francisco：7 1/2 <br>
    Geoff was introduced to me through my childhood friend Shaun. Geoff, a cinematographer, told me to come to the Tenderloin, the one area all the other people I met told me I should avoid. "I used to live here" he told me after I met him. "This is where you see reality." And real Geoff was, asking random guys on the street for a lighter. ("Guys" is putting it modestly haha) Geoff was absolutely aweseome, and you can see his personality through his 12 answers, how film and family has deeply affected him. Please read Q.11 and Q.12. Epic. I have to get this man over to Tokyo and create something incredible. A man I hope to work with in the future!! <br>
    And do check out his film: <a target="_blank" href="https://gtmtfilms.squarespace.com/reel/"> gtmtfilms.squarespace.com</a>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    We’re in Edinburgh’s Castle, a bar I frequent a lot, I know many of the people here, and has been the first stop of many nights that I went out. We’ll have meetings here, or I’ll just meet up with friends, get really drunk, and think of crazy ideas for films!  </p>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/geoff/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 Oh man, I’d go to Thailand. The reason why is…Thailand’s culture is just so crazy for me. I’ve seen it through all those National Geographics and pictures, and it just looks like a fun place to be. If I were to go I’d immediately try to find a subject to start filming and start a documentary, showcasing Thailand’s inner lifestyle. Not the beauty that the city holds but—when you’re a tourist you want to see all the pretty things of the city, but for me, I like getting down into the grittiness, wherever I am on the map. If I go to New York, I won’t go to the Statue of Liberty, but will try to get to Brooklyn and go to where Biggie lived and try get to know the local people in those parts. 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Man, I’d say Japan. The reason for that is I’ve housed Japanese exchange students since the 5th grade, almost every year. When I was living in Portland OR, I had 8 or 9 Japanese exchange students live with me, at a years time. I studied Japanese in High School. I just love the culture there, the bright lights, the fast pace of it. Its always a place I’ve wanted to travel to. 
<br><br>
>>>We need to get you there!! 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/geoff/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
One thing? Hmmm…I think the city is so diverse that the city itself represents a melting pot of different communities. You go to Chinatown, and you really feel like you’re a part of China. There are people there that don’t even speak English, its just crazy to me. Then you travel two miles out of the city and there’s the beach and you’re in the Sunset, a suburban neighbourhood. The city is so vivacious, looking at the number of people who live here and all the different lifestyles. Its becoming a tech city, but I still think its got its pizzazz as a melting pot. And I really like that about it. 
<br><br>
>>>So the melting pot for the thing…what about a place? 
<br><br>
You know its such a small city, I’d just say the city as a whole. It’s just 7 x 7 miles, it becomes really hard to pinpoint one spot. I could say Golden Gate Park, Bridge, the beach, places like Fisherman’s Wharf for the tourists, but they’re all so iconic you can’t really choose one place. 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   The American flag??? Oh man…I don’t think I could redesign it at all!! I think it holds so much iconic value in what it is that…there’s so much behind it, and we as Americans we stand so close to it, I don’t think it needs redesigning. The stripes—you know you hear so many Americans say “I bleed these colors” and its true, a lot of us, we’re all about our freedoms and, maybe we’re not the top in the world but dammit, if we’re not proud for what we are!! haha</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/geoff/3.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
 —The Ocean <br>
I see underwater photography…um, the life that is undiscovered. If it were one word for the ocean, it would be “the unknown.” 
<br><br>
—The Sun <br>
Power.   
<br><br>
—Death <br>
Images…for death…as an artist, for death, you know, its such a morbid thing, but in the world of art, brings so much. For me, it would be life. We as artists, we can create so much around death and so much to it we’re almost creating another life from something passing away.   

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
  You know for my self, I hope that I’ll be around to see it but, we’re headed towards such a tech savvy place…you know everyone is so into their phones. We’ve gone from a place where the cellphone was a means of communication to now its a calculator, I’ve got the internet, I’ve literally got everything that I never knew in my pocket, accessible anywhere, anytime. And from this on, we’re going to get to the point where we’re going to be stupider than the technology we’re creating or we’re going to advance as a human race to where we will create great things that will work with us, and not for us. And that’s the scary thing, that we’re creating a world where technology is doing things for us, an apathetic culture where we think, oh don’t worry the robot will do it, or don’t worry my phone will take care that. So I hope the future will be a place where we are working with the technology we create. 
<br><br>
>>>Gut feeling: which future seems more realistic??
<br><br>
Sadly, looking at the state of humans today, the apathetic society…
</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/geoff/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
For life itself…? For me it would be “family”. I feel like its cliche to say, but I wouldn’t be where I am today without my family. The support I got from them, I’ve gotten from nowhere else. When I’m down on my luck, my family is always there to pick me up. Its that and…you know, the industry that I’m in, the film industry, without that I’d be nothing. 
<br><br>
>>> So the film industry is also your family.
<br><br>
Yeah, oh yeah, the film industry is a huge part of my family.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Someone that is down to earth. You know, I, its bad to say but, I look at life as such a joke. I try to not take things too seriously…the way I look at the world, most people would get stressed out about it. I try to take everything with a grain of salt, and brush it off, and you have to continue to pick yourself back up. Yeah…wait what was the question again?? Haha oh yeah, what I look for in a partner! So yeah, someone that sees the world as something that they can laugh at. Someone that doesn’t take the world too seriously. So yeah, we can sit in bed for 8 hours in watch Netflix, or we can travel the world. Its up in the air, you know, someone that is down for anything. Also someone that won’t drag me down, but bring me up a few levels. Someone that will build you up. 
  </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Oh yeah, I grew up in a house where a lot of my friends had divorced parents or had single parents but my parents stuck together and…you know, they bicker like no ones business. Probably the best way to describe my parents is “That 70s show.“ My Mom’s name is actually Kitty, and my dad is a hard-ass, but I love them both to death. And I view that as what I want. I want kids, I want a family.
<br><br>

>>>how do you want them to grow up?? 
<br><br>
You know you see a lot of kids these days with their iPads and always indoors, but for me when I was a kid I was always outdoors and thats where I found half my toys. My parents…I didn’t grow up poor or wealthy, but I grew up in a good means of a family where my dad made me work for anything that I wanted. If I wanted an allowance, I had to fucking work for it, I didn’t just get money by being a seed of his, I had to earn respect in that forefront. And thats what I want to have for my kids too…where whatever wealth that I hopefully will bring to my family, I still want them to know the value of a dollar, and understand that nothing in life comes for free. Even if you’re a gorgeous girl…shit fades, and either you have brains behind it or you’re going to be the one behind. 
<br><br>

>>>What do you want to do with them?? 
<br><br>
You know… I really would love my son to become an athlete haha. My dad really pushed me into athletics.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting coming from a guy in film!
<br><br>
Yeah but even before I found film, and even during film I was into athletics. In school I was a wrestler for 8 years. It was a very strict sport, with strict rules where you had to cut weight—I had to once cut 20 pounds in a day—and it taught me a lot about discipline, even in life in general. And I want to teach that to my kids. I don’t want them to kinda limp by, be pathetic, not have heart, you know. I want to toughen up my kids a little bit, and I think sports does that.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Like for the rest of my life? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah…so it could be your ideal life.
<br><br>
My beautiful wife next to me. 
<br><br>
>>>For both?
<br><br>
Yeah absolutely. I mean, if I found the right girl, I’d love to marry her up and…I, I’m such a hopeless romantic in terms of that haha. I would love to grow up, grow old with a woman, wake up next to her morning and smile, go to bed knowing that she will be there when I wake up and be happy about that! 
 </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
I think…we’ll start with the good, I think the happiest moment of my life was…man…one of the happiest moments of my life was when my nephew was born. Yeah, when I was able to hold him in my arms for the first time…I was like bawling. And it was really rad! You know… he was born when I was 22, so he’s 4 years old now, and I look at him, this is a kid that I can sort of look after, and teach things to….it sort of made me grow up in a sense, It made me realise, there is life beyond mine. And that’s another thing I like doing is teaching things. I like nerding out. In my field, as a film maker, if there’s a new kid on the set, I love teaching them stuff. Nerding out with them. I always go up to them and say, if there’s anything you need, you have any questions, just let me know. And that’s what I do with my nephew too. Its so much fun. He’s so curious about the world, wanting to know everything as a 4 year old, asking me questions. And I try to dumb them down so he can understand, the world is so hard for him haha.
 <br><br>

Scariest moment of my life…man…scariest moment…there’s so many (laughs) You know for me, fear…fear is a builder of confidence. Once you get past that hump of fear, it makes you into something. You know, probably the scariest moment of my life was when I did horrible on my first big project. Basically dropped the ball completely. I was a super young kid in college and was given an opportunity to shoot on film. I was given a 35mm and I hadn’t done it before other than tests in school. I was I think 19 at the time, the youngest guy on set…every one else was 25, 26, and they were looking at me for answers, and a lot of the times I wouldn’t have them. I’d be sweating bullets everyday. When the film came back—we were shooting in Tahoe, which was super cold and we couldn’t acclimate the lenses, which means… when you leave the lenses inside where it warms it fogs up because of the difference in temperature, and we didn’t know that. Actually I think my assistant camera person told me but I didn’t listen to her because I didn’t know what she was talking about, but when the film came back, everything was blurry. And at that point I realised I just wasted $15,000 worth of someones’ money, and I thought that my career, even before getting out of college, was over. And it did set me back…people heard about it, its a small community out here, and people talk. It cost me a little bit. And at that moment I almost gave up on my goal as a cinematographer. I almost went back home. I’d call my mom crying and be like “I, I fucked up. Everyone hates me. No one trusts me anymore” and she was like, (laughs) “If I were right next you right now I’d slap you in the face and tell you to  get back up on that fucking horse! Keep doing it!!” (everyone laughs) Thats really the only thing you can do. Fail, and get back up. I’ve learned more from my failures than my successes, so after that I always looked at moments of fear, moments where I’m scared out of my fucking mind, and looked at it as something I can grow from. I can learn from. That I can take criticism. And it made me the person I am today. </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
So my childhood dream…see my father was a photographer in the Air Force. He was a fighter pilot, but after his vision started going bad, they sent him to do the newspaper photography. So he picked up a camera, and loved it, and never put it down. And it was only after he came back from the military and met my mom, and they started getting serious, that he thought, “I need a real job.” Especially in the 60’s and the 70’s, film photography really wasn’t a huge thing. There was only a handful of people who could make it their profession, and he realised that he needed to belt up, be man, get a 9 to 5, and support his family. <br>
  　　For me…so when I was a kid I found his cameras in our basement, I think I was 12 or 13 at the time. I’d ask him about them, and he gave me one of his Canon cameras. A really old F1. And I would just start taking random photos. Half of them would never turn out, but my dad would keep on giving me film. He’d teach me, this is how you load a camera, this is how you do it, just keep shooting. Yeah… I just loved framing things. I saw the world in a different light after that. For a while I wanted to be a paparazzi haha, but then Princess Diana died because of them and I was like “I don’t want to do that! I don’t want to kill people!!” And from there, I moved on to film. I did a lot of studying on my own, during school…I didn’t do much in school, I hated school, I hated math, science, all that, and I’d skip class, go smoke weed with my friends, ditch everything. <br>
   　　But then I found film in my high school. Mr. Bennett, who was the film teacher at my school, was the first teacher ever to tell me I was doing good. Keep doing this, you have an eye for this, this is something you could be good at. And hearing positive reinforcement from a teacher…that just blew me away. I had a Language Arts teacher who told me, based on <i>my sister’s</i> reputation in high school, that I would amount to nothing.  She negated me from the start, treated me like shit, so I was like “Fuck you! I’m not going to do anything for you then!” So I’d skip her class and go to Mr. Bennett’s class, and watch kids make film, and talk to him about film. He was such a beaming light of hope in my academic life that, if he wasn’t around, if my school didn’t offer that program, I wouldn’t know where I’d be. Then senior year came and I became the head of the school news cast, and we basically changed the format from a regular news report to a sort of SNL skit kind of deal. We would write skits to deliver news to people, in a fun way. <br>
  　　It was sort of like that psychology where we would trick kids into learning things, in a fun way, not just feeding them facts. After the teacher would leave class, and homeroom would go insane—we’d sneak in and write on the chalk board “Assembly at this time” and kids would all show up and we’d do skits and everybody loved it!! It was really fun. It taught me a lot of discipline, and a lot of leadership skills which leads me to where I am now. 
<br><br>
   　　If I were to see my past self now…wow, I would probably punch him in the face, and tell him to stop being such a dick (everyone laughs). Yeah its like…yeah I would tell him, listen, you love this. DO IT. Be passionate about it. Pursue it harder than you ever think you can. Like sweat over it. BLEED over it. Let this be your life. If I could tell my self that, and grow up to be that guy, damn man, I don’t know where I’d be right now. I’d probably be shooting Spielberg’s movies right now haha. Its like what I’d like to do to my kids. I want to find what they love, support them, and push them to the brink. I obviously won’t punch them in the face though haha, but I’ll do everything in my power so they can be successful at what they are passionate about. 
<br><br>
>>>And your dream now?? 
<br><br>
My dream now is, I want to shoot feature films. I want to work with the big shots. I want to have Martin Scorsese call me up and say, “Geoff, I love your stuff. Shoot for me” My goal in life is to win an Oscar. I want to be the youngest cinematographer to win an Oscar. I want to show the world that, its not age that determines talent, because in my field, its such an age heavy thing where people look at you as a 26 year old shooting and say “you don’t have the experience.” But no, I do, and I’ve got the heart, I’ve got the heart and the vision. The technical side will come as I grow older, and I know that, I’m ready for that, I’m excited for that, but the vision. That’s what will forever be there. You could be a 16 year old kid, and you could have a better vision than a 50 year old guy shooting commercials for a car company. So I hope eventually people will look at me not for my age, but my ability and vision as an artist.
