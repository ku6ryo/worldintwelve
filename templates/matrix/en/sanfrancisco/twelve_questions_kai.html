    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：２５　Years in Tokyo：２５<br>
    Nanako is the wife of one of my cohord when I worked at TV Asahi. When I first met her, we were all still in school, and I remember having the initial thought, "This is one funky girl!" We were eating at a Korean restaurant in Shin-Okubo (the Korean neighborhood of Tokyo), and Nanako was chugging down her beer, arguing with her American footballing, Hugh Jackman look-alike, then boyfriend now husband Lucas, about Ozzy Osbourne and Lenny Kravitz. Not your ordinary Japanese college girl. So when I found out Nanako was pregnat, of course I was overjoyed and gave all my blessings, but I also thought to myself, "Nanako with a baby? I've got to get her in a few projects!!" I hope she won't judge me for this. <br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u><br>The place I chose for the shooting is Nezu shrine. The reason I chose it was because its like the symbol for the area in Tokyo that I was born and raised. Its where I used to play around when I was a child. I was here everday! <br>
    <br>
    >>>What exactly did you play with?<br>
    Everything! I mean, I was even jumping in that lake overthere!! haha. Also, this is also where I would come when I would fight with my dad and run away from home. <br>
    <br>
    >>>What? You slept in a shrine?? That's not scary...<br>
    Yeah it was so scary!! haha. But it was only about 5 minutes from home so I guess it wasn't really "running away."</p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
    Well since I'm pregnant now, a month would be around when I'll be giving birth. But say I weren't pregnant, I'd probably like to go to France again. France is my husband's father's homeland, and it also happens to be the first country that I went abroad. And I really fell in love with the country--of course, at the time I couldn't imagine I would one day marry a frenchman--but now my friends give the "Uh huh, coincidence, riiiiight" reaction all the time! haha. <br>
　　 When I visit France this time, I'd like to try to view the city and country through my step-father and mother's eyes. Last time I was just sight seeing, but this time, I'd like to try to walk through the city as I walk through my hometown. </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
    I haven't really been to many countries, but when I talk to people from different countries, I feel like each person has their own similarities and differences. However, I do believe Parisians are similar to Tokyoites, in many ways. Parisians really love and are proud of the city and area they live in. Also the fact that there is a vast difference in the people who are native Parisians, and people who came from elsewhere, I belieive is really similar to Tokyo. Some of the natives are extremely conservative and excluding, but others are very open and welcoming, and the people from elsewhere don't really care and happily live their daily lives. <br>
　  Also, the fact that there are historical monuments throughout the city, like this shrine, is also very similar. Especially the fact that to tourists, this is an attraction, but to the locals, its just normal life. And the fact that the locals use it as an opportunity for business is also very similar, I believe. </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What do you look for in a partner?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
    The most important thing is, does this person like good food? I love eating good food with people, and if a person can't relate to this, I don't really think I could date him. </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q4</em><br>
    What one place and thing best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    Hmmm...(thinks for a bit)...as an area, I believe this Yanesen area best represents Tokyo. Of course, if I were taking around tourists from foreign countries I'd take them to Shibuya, Aasakusa, the Tokyo Skytree, etc, but I truly believe this Yanesen area has it all too. There are old places and new places, all mixed together. I believe a city will slowly start to die out unless it is constantly evolving, bringing in new ideas, and I think the Yanesen area is doing a great job of this. Its very "Iki"(粋)！(A traditional Japanese word meaning "Stylish, smart, chic, fashionable, etc.")　<br>
　 As for a "thing"...hmmm...maybe, buildings? Real estate? I don't think there are many cities like Tokyo, even throughout the world, where you go two train stations down and there is a completely different city-scape. Shibuya, Shinjuku, Asakusa--all the buildings are so different. Its like there are a bunch of small cities in this giant megalopolis known as Tokyo. </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
    >>>The Ocean<br>
"Fear"...? I guess. At first, I imagine sunny beaches and happy thoughts, but those instantly get devoured by the image of the deep, dark, sea. Very frightening. <br>
>>>The Sun <br>
This may be stereotypical, but in Japan, the sun is used as a metaphor to describe a type of person. So I get the image of people I guess. <br>
>>>Death<br>
Hmmm...obviously, everything is unknown, but I do believe there is a connection. I don't believe all is over after death...so the image I hold isn't "fear." "The unknown" is a more fitting image. </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
    If you could redesign your country’s flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
   Hmmm...I've never really thought of this, but I don't think I would redesign it actually. It sort of has to do with the fact that I have no sense in design, but I do like it as the way it is. </p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/tokyo/twelve_questions/nanako/photo6.jpg">
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
     What do you want to do with your children? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
This is a topic I've been thinking a lot about lately, and I actually posed this question for the project because I really wanted to know what others were thinking. I myself really don't hold an image of "how" I want my child to grow up... But if I were to give one thing, I wouldn't want my child to become some one who hurts people, and at the same time, I don't want my child to become a person who is easily hurt. There are words all over that you hear everyday that can hurt you, in the spur of the moment, but when you think thouroughly about them, each one is completely weak and meaningless.
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything you want to do with him/her?
<br>
Oh of course!! First, I want to go to a farm! haha. Also, I want to dance with him/her. I'll play some music at night--I've got the song already, its ”<a target="_blank" 
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unnh0T2Ftro">Dancing in the Moonlight</a>” by Thin Lizzy--and I'll turn down the lights, be a little tipsy, and dance with him/her!! 　
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep? </p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
   Not what I see everyday, right? Hmmm...morning...(thinks for a bit)...what I want to see in the morning...breakfast? haha. Breakfast that someone made for me! I wake up, and my eyes are still adjusting to the light, and BAM!! Breakfast at my bed!! <br><br>

>>>So I'm assuming Lucas doesn't make breakfast for you.<br><br>

Never！I haven't seen him in the kitchen once!! haha <br>
　What I want to see before I go to bed is my husband's face. He's so busy with work he's never at home, so usually I fall asleep before he comes home. So being able to go to bed together, and seeing him sleeping is really a happy moment for me.

<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
    What is the most important “thing” for you?</p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Can this be, what is the most important thing for me now?<br><br>

>>>Yes, now works.<br><br>

What I'm spending a lot of time on, thinking about, worrying about, and trying to make sense of is the concept of "love." Because I don't understand it, and I can't really tell what it is. I now have a family, a baby, and I often ask my self this question, "what is love?" Is <i>this</i> "love"? I live with this question everday. Recently, the concept of love is really a factor when I'm making decisions or thinking about something. 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
 What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most frightening moment in your life?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
   The happiest time was when I found out I was pregnant!<br><br>

>>>Didn't see that one coming! haha<br><br>

Yeah, I know haha. I bet the readers are all thiking, all this girl talks about is her baby, but its true!! <br>
　The most frightening moment was, well this is really private but, it was when my Dad cheated on my Mom, and my Mom was going hysterical, and she had a knife by her pillow when going to bed!!! I was so scared. Up until then we were an ordinary happy family, but that's when I first realized my father was a man, and my mother was a woman, and that they were both human, if that makes sense. Also the fact that there was a knife next to a pillow, it was so surreal, it was frightening! </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
    What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now?</p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
I wanted to become a lawyer when I was young. That's what I wrote in school, and answered to anyone who asked, but to tell the truth, I really had no idea what a lawyer was! haha. I just had the image that it was someone that protected people. And eventually, still without really knowing what a lawyer was, I enterend university and majored in law. That's when I realized, wow, law is boring! So if I could say something to the childhood me, it would be this: don't say you want to become something when you have no idea what that is! Just say, a florist or something! haha. </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
Finally, what is your dream now?</p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
I have two. One is to raise this child to become a respected adult, and have a happy family. <br>
The other is, I want to write something. Anything really. I want to write something--it doesn't have to be published--and I want it to have an impact on the people close to me, special to me. I've always liked to write, so I want to show it to people, and hope it influences or makes them think in some way. It's still all up in the air, but that is my dream!
