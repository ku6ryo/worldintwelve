    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：21　Years in San Francisco：1<br>
    Nanako is the wife of one of my cohord when I worked at TV Asahi. When I first met her, we were all still in school, and I remember having the initial thought, "This is one funky girl!" We were eating at a Korean restaurant in Shin-Okubo (the Korean neighborhood of Tokyo), and Nanako was chugging down her beer, arguing with her American footballing, Hugh Jackman look-alike, then boyfriend now husband Lucas, about Ozzy Osbourne and Lenny Kravitz. Not your ordinary Japanese college girl. So when I found out Nanako was pregnat, of course I was overjoyed and gave all my blessings, but I also thought to myself, "Nanako with a baby? I've got to get her in a few projects!!" I hope she won't judge me for this. <br>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   I would go to Spain and...um, I would just live...I guess do a little sightseeing and hopefully learn Spanish, because Spanish is one of the languages I want to learn the most right now. And definitely check out Spanish girls haha...wait don’t put that in the text...wait, no I don’t mind haha </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 What if I said I don’t feel close to any countries? 
<br><br>
>>>That’s a great answer. 
<br><br>
I don’t feel close to any countries because I moved around all my life, and even though my parents are from Taiwan, I spent most of my life in Japan. The school I attended was an international school so all my classes were in English, and...after I dropped out I worked full time doing random things, switching between jobs in Japan. Being in a professional environment in Japan, though, made me realize Japan wasn’t the place for me… Yeah, I don’t think Japan is… I don’t really consider any place home. Wherever I am is my home. 
</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
    I think one thing that represents the city, or one word that best describes San Francisco is “diversity.” There’s a place for everyone. There’s gay people, lesbians, bisesxuals, there’s a place for everyone and that’s why I like this place. I’m straight, but I have a lot of gay friends, even in Japan too but, yeah the diversity is what best describes San Francisco. 
<br><br>
>>>What about a place? 
<br><br>
For me, I think its the Mission district. Its where all the people who like fashion hang out. I think the people in San Francisco are really sensitive to fashion, and the Mission is the district that best represents that. 
    <p>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    Um...hmm...I don’t know. I’m sorry. I don’t have an opinion on the American flag. I’m not American! </p>
<br>

<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
    >>>The Ocean<br>
Um...when I think of the word ocean, it reminds me of a quote by...who was it...Shakespeare! It goes “To Unpathed Waters, Undreamed Shores.” It’s one of my favorie quotes. That’s what I think of when I hear the word ocean. <br><br>
>>>The Sun <br>
The sun...rising sun...Japan??  <br><br>
>>>Death<br>
Death...hmmm...its something Steve Jobs said, “Death is the best invetion.” Should I go into details? Ok, so Steve Jobs said this because, knowing that you’re going to die will strip you away from the fear of failure, embarrassment, and all those negative things, and will help you realize what you want to do in your life. Because you know you’ll die eventually anyway. 
<br><br>
>>>Great! A Steve Jobs quote in San Francisco!! haha  
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
   For me, I’m excited about the future, because right now I’m in a big transition phase. Until last year, I was a high school dropout, by next year I’ll be going to a really good school, hopefully, so I have really good feelings toward the future. <br>
  For people in general, I have really good faith and hope, because right now, everything, especially technology, is advancing in exponential speed. All these useful inventions are being taken place. Up until a number of years ago, no one was using Facebook or Instagram, not everyone was so connected. Its drastically changing the way we live our lives. I have no idea what it will be like in the future, but I’m excited.  </p>

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
The most important thing for me is...I guess, “influences.” The influences are what made me the way I am right now. When I was in middle and high school I got straight Fs and I was like,  well I wasn’t involved in school. I skipped school and went drinking, but I was influenced by many people who changed the way I was. If my classmates saw me right now, they’d be amazed at how much I’ve changed. So I guess influences are the most important thing for me. That’s also what I hope to provide people when I’m older.  
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
   Um...intelligence and ambition. Because I think...I like girls who have a dream, and are doing something to chase that dream. So, yeah ambitious girls are attractive...and I believe that’s one of the most important things. </p>
 <br>

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage:Yeah Kids: Yeah! 
<br><br>
I want them to be successfull, and whatever that they choose to do, I want them to take it seriously. I want them to put 120% into whatever their passion is going to be. Because that’s something that I lacked when I was a kid. My parents didn’t support me on anything I did. So that’s what I hope to provide my kids, and I hope they can find passion in something.
<br><br>
>>>What do you want to do with them?
<br><br>
I want to spend a lot of time with them, I guess. Because my Dad never really spent time with me. It’s something… well I have no clue what it would be like to have kids but I’d like to spend time with them.
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
The beach! 
<br><br>
>>>Any specific beach?? 
<br><br>
Santa Monica! 
<br><br>
>>>And before you go to bed? 
<br><br>
Hmmm...what’s the last thing I want to see….hmm nothing really. Yeah I don’t know.
<br><br>
>>>What’s the last thing you see before you go to sleep now? Your phone?? 
<br><br>
Yeah, my phone. 
<br><br>
>>>Is that ideal? 
<br><br>
I actually organize my schedule for the next day on my phone before I go to sleep so…
<br><br>
>>>Oh so it’s necessary huh haha 
 </p>
 <br>

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
The happiest moment is...now? Not just now but ever since I moved here I guess. Actually, the answer to  the happiest moment and most frightening moment would both be now. Because I’m taking a big step in my life, trying to turn my life around, going from a high school dropout to going to a four year university. And even though I still haven’t achieved it, working towards it makes me happy, to see the progress I made. At the same time its frightening because I never know what’s going to happen in the next moment, or tomorrow, or next week. So, yeah.  </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to become an astronaut, and if I could tell him something now...hmm...I would probabaly tell him...no don’t become an astronaut! haha. No, I probably wouldn’t tell him anything, to be honest. Because if I don’t tell him anything, he will live the life I’ve lived right now, and I wouldn’t change a thing about my childhood. I didn’t have the best childhood, but I wouldn’t change anything because its what made me the way I am right now. 
<br><br>
>>>What is your dream now? 
<br><br>
My dream now...is to finish college and start working, I guess. I can’t wait to start working and maybe get my own apartment? Or my first non-used car!
