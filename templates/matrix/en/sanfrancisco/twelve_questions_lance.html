    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in San Francisco：Bay Area Entire Life, SF 6 1/2 <br>
     <br> Lance was introduced to me through Geoff, when he joined us for drinks after Geoff's shoot. Lance is basically the definition of chill--from the photographs he takes, to his attitude towards life. For his 12 Questions, I got to join him in his backyard for his own shoot, with the lovely designer Gabriella (who will be coming later!). It was an incredible experience: the weather, the scene, the light, everything was perfect. And his basement (which you'll see in the video version at the end of the year) was the coolest thing ever. I wish I had his basement. Now! Lance's views on life are splattered throughout his answers, but if I had to choose a few, I would say his SF one thing (Q.3) imagery (Q.5) most important thing (Q.7) and dream (Q.12) truly showed his personality. Thanks Lance, and we need to get you pretty girls on this side of the pacific for pictures!! haha <br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: I chose this place because I end up doing a lot of shoots here, a lot of test shoots, I do a lot of my brain storming, and a lot of my ideas end up coming together in this location, my backyard, and right now here, which is my basement.   </p>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/lance/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 Anywhere in the world…hmm…does the 2500 dollars include travel expenses? No? So just spending money…oh man. I think I’d probably…I have two different places, either India of Alaska. Alaska is a place I really wanted to go to for a long time. It’s part of the United States, but its outside the lower 48, and its…well I love snowboarding, I love cold weather, and I feel like its just a place in the US and the world that has so much uncharted territory. A lot of new things, and incredible landscapes, weather, and just a lot of extremes. Yeah so that’s a place I want to go…I’d probably spend part of that money on a helicopter snowboarding trip, so I could get photos of all the mountain ranges as well as enjoying myself. <br>
And India, just because the vibrance, life, and color, and how culturally different it is from where I am now. And when I think of India, I imagine―I can’t say for sure yet―but I feel like it has a spirit to it. Its very different and unique. Its something that I’d feel would be very valuable to experience. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Other than the United States…hmm, I don’t know. I haven’t really travelled out of the Unites States. Just last year I travelled to London, and I felt pretty close there. But I think that primarily because, well, culturally there are similarities, and then there’s the fashion aspect, the creative aspect of the people and the city itself. And I think I feel closest to it because of the history, the buildings, the juxtaposition between the old and the new. There could be new buildings, a high riser being built, but two blocks down there’s a thousand year old church, right there. So I feel the closest to that in a sense because I could see myself living there, but also the closest because its a lot of what I enjoy was there. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/lance/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I would say, for me, is Golden Gate Park. A lot of people imagine the downtown scene, and the high-rises out there, but as an icon, Golden Gate Park has something to offer that has been portrayed in a lot of movies, its in a lot of different things. And when I’m in Golden Gate Park I feel like I’m in the heart of San Francisco. Its got an area that still has buffalo, or bison,   and yeah, its the one area that is still untouched―I don’t want to say completely untouched because its been changed from its original landscape into a park―but in terms for geography, and the plants that grow there, its still the same landscape as before, and I believe that represents San Francisco. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you have a “thing”? 
<br><br>
A thing? That represents San Francisco?? Well there’s obviously the Golden Gate Bridge which is an iconic thing, if you can call it a thing, but I don’t know. I think one thing that represents San Francisco is the combination of laid-back and adventurous attitude that the people here have.  Just very much so…the thing would be the acceptance that people have. There aren’t many people here that will be like “No, you shouldn’t do that” or “No that’s stupid”. People will always tell you “Yeah, go ahead and do that”, whatever, whether its different, people are always accepting of whatever you want to do. That would sort of be my thing.  
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Um, yeah, I don’t think…(laughs)…yeah I don’t think I could. I <i>could</i> but it would be too much of an undertaking…. And I don’t know how else we could represent our nation with the knowledge and everything I have. There’s so much history, within our design, and the meanings behind it, that I don’t think I could do any justice to it at all. I could redesign it but it would probably be total crap haha.  </p>
<br>

<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
―The Ocean<br>
The ocean…well obviously the sand, the waves, but when I think about the ocean here in San Francisco, I think about the fact that its cold haha. Both the water, and generally the temperature within the city, and even the beach because you have more wind. What I think of particularly of the ocean here is the waves crashing against the rocks, and different jetties and piers and stuff like that we have out here. 
<br><br>
―The Sun<br>
The sun is warmth and growth and sweat,
<br><br>
>>>Sweat??
<br><br>
Haha yeah, growing up in Livermore, its like the valley compared to the bay. So the summers are upwards of a 110 degrees F sometimes, and it gets quite a bit colder in the winter. I don’t ever recall it snowing but it gets a bit colder. And I was very active as a kid, especially in the summertime because I wasn’t in school, skateboarding and all that, I definitely remember myself being hot and sweaty.  And I personally prefer cold weather, and the sun has a lot to do with that. <br>
But other than that, yeah, warmth, growth and energy. You could be having a shitty morning and be stuck in your own little groove, not feeling so great, and all it takes is stepping out in the sun for a few minutes and feel reenergized and new. 
<br><br>
―-Death<br>
Death? Um, when I think of death, I don’t know. I almost think of death as not necessarily as a permanent thing…? Nor necessarily in a negative connotation. There is a pretty common quote where people explain death as the only thing you’re guaranteed in life, which I don’t necessarily agree with, but to an extent. I guess when I consider death I think about the decaying of what’s old and how it ends up feeding what’s new. So I would think of death as…when I think of death I also think of, you know, giving opportunity, or giving way to something new. And of course death is always going to be a new experience…I haven’t experienced it yet, and when I do, I won’t be here to tell you about it! 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 Um, I think right now, my outlook of the future is…I think its promising, I think right now, the state of mankind, there is a lot of controversy and uncertainty over what the future can hold. Both what we’re dealing with culturally, or climate wise, with all the wars and everything that’s being fought and you know, what is it…all the combativeness, the corruption… But with all that said we have a lot of opportunity to improve, to change in a positive way. Mankind as a whole is technically considered an infective species…um, we are like rats in a sense. We move into that environment and we overgrow that environment and then we move on. But we’re not in a position to move on from earth just yet,  and I don’t think colonizing Mars or anything is necessarily a good idea. I think we should be able to live sustainably on this planet before we go infesting other planets. So I think there is a lot open for change and progression, and I just hope mankind as a whole can handle that.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
I would say…um, yeah, I would say I have two things. The first thing is fun and enjoyment. What’s life if you’re not going to be having fun with it? I’m not a hopeless romantic, per se, where you know, to the extent of where I’m always sad because I’m not achieving something I can’t reach. But yeah, fun. I have a tattoo across my chest that says “Have More Fun” because I don’t see there being any reason to argue with that. <br>
  The other thing would be to leave…the reason I’m a photographer is so I want to be able to leave behind images and things that are larger than me, and create something that wasn’t there before. Something greater than myself. 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
A partner? Someone that both supports me and challenges me. Someone that is different than me. Someone that I can teach my perspective and my way of things, and also someone that can do the same for me. Challenge me to look at things differently. And someone that can share the companionship and compassion to the extent that we put up with each other and love each other nonetheless. 
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/lance/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Um, yes, not necessarily in the traditional sense…you know, I don’t consider…if and when I get married it won’t be a traditional wedding, in a church with all the religious sides to it and all of that. I do believe the…joining of two things and becoming one, and that meaning and value…so yeah, in the future I would like to get married, one day. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you want children? 
<br><br>
Right now…well yeah, in the future, with said person, yeah. Yeah I would like to have children. Right now no, but in the future, I do believe its and important thing to continue on my name, and also the things I believe in, my values…I want to have someone that can carry on what I have made in my life and make it their own. Take what I have taught them and create something beautiful and unique that’s their own as well. That sort of goes back to the whole “creating something that is larger than me”. 
<br><br>
>>>So you sort of answered the second part of the question, but do you have anything else to add?? 
<br><br>
Yeah (laughs) so I just want them to grow up feeling like…well you know, obviously I’m going to try and influence them and show them things that I do, but I don’t want to put them in any means where they feel like they’re forced to do a certain thing. I just want them to feel supported and do…and feel like they can do the things they like. I want to teach them that taking risks and failing is avery important part of growing. So giving them the opportunity to take risks, and to fail. I don’t want to shelter my child to the point where they’re not capable of dealing with hardship, but I don’t want leave them in the dust and force them to struggle. I just want them to understand the values of both sides.

<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Yeah, I think that is a two part question with one answer, which would be my significant other. Definitely. I feel like its…well, creatively, I feel like its important to collaborate with other artists and everything because, I forgot the saying but…what is it, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts? Yeah, so I think waking up next to my partner, my soulmate, my companion, that is what I want to see in both cases.

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Happiest moment…I actually think it pertains with what happened on my 24th birthday…? I drove up to Tahoe, and it was snowing, and I just wanted to go snowboarding. I met up with one friend, and it was probably the best day of snowboarding that I ever had. I don’t think I fell one time the entire day. It was kind of like a, well some sort of birthday gift from the universe. But there was one point where I…so the happiest moment was when I saw this cliff ahead of me, and my buddy just stopped right before it, and I just charged through. When I came off the end of it, I didn’t really quite know what was underneath…so when I came off of it was probably the most terrifying moment of my life, and when I landed it was the happiest moment of my life. The feeling of letting go, of essentially just leaving things up to fate. And when I landed, it just felt so good! This feeling, it was a moment where I couldn’t help but just yell. Just excitement, and satisfaction. 
<br><br>
>>>That is so cool haha
<br><br>
Yeah, it was a quick turn of events haha
<br><br>
>>>So you really had no idea what was below you? 
<br><br>
Well, yeah I knew the resort we were at, and I knew the area we were riding in, but…more or less, I have to say I was careless. My buddy stopped to look, to see what was below, but I was just like “I’m going for it”. So that feeling of letting go, was both terrifying and amazing, and when I landed and rode away, that was the best feeling of all. 

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My dream now…well lets start with the first part. As a child, I think my dream was to be…well I went to space academy, kind of thinking I wanted to be an astronaut…I think I had all the general childhood dreams haha. I wanted to be a firefighter, some kind of hero, in a sense, astronaut. And as I grew up I realised, well you know, life’s limitations within itself, and actually started to realise what being shot into space actually entails? From there my dreams sort of became more realistic, and more…vague? Because as I grew they went from something less specific of what to do, to more of a “I just want to be happy. I want to have fun!”, whatever it is I’m doing. That’s why I think I’ve had so many different jobs, take so many different paths. I’ve done everything from property management, to graphic design, to photography, to working at a large scale mechanical union repairing steam turbines in power plants and refineries. <br><br>
What I’d tell my childhood self is, well, you know, its OK to not be sure of what you want to be doing in your life. That thing will eventually find you. Leave yourself open to try new things, and to be…to explore, and to fail, and to succeed. And I think my ultimate goal now is to keep creating, to keep building on my own body of work, and also my own happiness and the happiness of those around me. My friends and my family…and to have a wealth of not just money, but friendship, and people, companions, associates, that I can work with, who are like minded, and would like to work towards the same goal of making something larger than the parts involved.
