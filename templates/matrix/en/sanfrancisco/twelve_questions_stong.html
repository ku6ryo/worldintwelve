    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：25　Years in San Francisco：2 (23 in the Bay Area)<br>
    Stephanie was introduced to me through Nana, who was a college friend of Stephanie's while they were both abroad in Jakarta. Stephanie really REALLY helped me out from the biginning, introducing me to people, places, and the culture of San Francisco when I first got here. I can't thank her enough. Her answers to the questions are very interesting, as in that I think they truly reflect a person in her mid-twenties, in SF, living in 2015, if that makes any sense. Her ideas on her career, partner, future, and even happy and frightening times are so true and relatable, it makes you think, wait, is she me? Haha. Again thanks Stephanie, I hope we can meet again, and I'll probably be bothering you with more questions in the future!! :)  <br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    So this place is called the Conservatory of Flowers in Golden Gate Park, and it’s a location that is just a couple miles away from my apartment. I find myself here often when I need a peace of mind and a breath of fresh air.  </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 To be honest I’d do a lot of nothing! Um…work is stressful, and sometimes you just need to unplug. So if I had that money to spend I’d go to somewhere that is secluded and beautiful, maybe a warm beach, be one with nature, and literally just unplug from all the things that keep you hyped up all the time. 
<br><br>
>>>Would you say…read? Or really just do nothing??
<br><br>
Yeah I’d read. I’d probably also do some hiking, people watching, or…just being in nature haha That’s what I do now too when I find that I have some free time. So I don`t think it would be too different, just a change in scenery. 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 My family is from Hong Kong, so that’s probably what I relate to in terms of ethnicity. I was born and raised in the United States, but I feel very close ties with Hong Kong still. Most of my extended family still lives over there and I visit once every one or two years. 
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
   One thing…”The Cloud.” Or the new San Francisco, “Tech 2.0.” Yeah that’s kind of the new face of San Francisco in the last 5 years…technology, but nothing that you can really touch. 
<br><br>
>>>What one place?? 
<br><br>
Hmm…Golden Gate Bridge. I mean, its iconic, its prevalent almost everywhere you go. You can usually see it peaking somewhere. Also the fog. It’s impermeable. And it’s usually everywhere, especially in this neighborhood. 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   Haha…I’d probably choose different colors! I feel that red white blue is overused. I don’t really mind the stars and stripes iconology…just a little more creative with the color palette.

<br><br>
>>>Are there any colors you’d like off the top your head? 
<br><br>
No, not at all haha  </p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/stong/3.jpg">
<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
 ——The Ocean<br>
Peace…there’s just something about staring out at the ocean that just brings peace of mind. Um…it’s one of my favourite places to go actually, when I want to see something beautiful. And it’s so easy when you’re here. Just two miles to the west. 
<br><br>
>>>And the north too huh.
<br><br>
Yeah, you’re surrounded by the ocean.  
<br><br>
—-The Sun<br>
Warmth…do you want me to elaborate? Yeah [San Francisco is] a cold place so when the sun comes out, I’m always outside.  
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, those are the answers I’m looking for haha
<br><br>
Yeah, its like, right now its the middle of winter, but honestly it feels like this year round. It doesn’t really get much warmer or colder than this. 
<br><br>
>>>Which is interesting, because I’d think this for winter is really warm for most people in the world.
<br><br>
Yeah but when you feel this in July, you get a little confused haha
<br><br>
——Death <br>
Loneliness…just pitch black. 
<br><br>
>>>Just the image of blackness?
<br><br>
Yeah…I don’t really believe any form of after life so, the idea of death just seems like such a lonely place, with nothing there.   

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
  Optimistic, with an asterisk. Everything is so global now, it’s so easy to learn, or communicate across borders, but at the same time everyone’s kind of retreating into their smartphones and tablets. Like, whenever you go out to dinner, there’s a chance at one point you’ll be surrounded by 4 people all looking at their smartphones at the same time. So I’m excited that humanity is becoming so close, and within reach, but at the same time I don’t want people to lose sight of actual, tangible contact. I don’t want it to become…what’s that? Wall-E movie? I don’t want it to look like that in the future.  </p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/stong/4.jpg">
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
What do you mean? 
<br><br>
>>>Well, people don’t usually answer actual objects here haha
<br><br>
Haha I see…Happiness. And I think that this is pretty common with the people in my generation. It’s to find a way of life that makes you happy, regardless of whether that’s wealth or romance or whatever, it has a lot of different meanings to different people. I’m not sure what true happiness feels like for me yet… it’s a longer life goal. But…I hope I’m happy someday!! 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  Um, people with similar interests, people with long-term similar aspirations. Physical attraction is very important. I’m not looking for a carbon copy of myself, but someone that can respect the way I think, and can kind of emphasize the best in me. 
<br><br>
>>>what do you mean by “long term aspirations”?
<br><br>
Hmmm, whether its career wise or, you know, where you want to live in the future. Um, I guess similar family goals…? Stuff like that.  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/stong/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
I think so….I mean, its just something that people are born to expect, right? Haha You’re supposed to get married!!
<br><br>
>>>We’ll find out as I conduct this project huh haha
<br><br>
Yeah haha. 
<br><br>
>>>Children? 
<br><br>
Unclear. I can’t even take care of myself properly yet…I can’t thing of taking care of anything living, other than myself haha. So, maybe in the future, when I feel more mature about it. Maybe. 
<br><br>
>>>So lets say in the future you do have children. Is there anything you want to do with them? 
<br><br>
Um, growing up I was given every opportunity to experience as much as possible, from an early age, whether that was travelling, extra-curriculars. My parents always allowed me to try something once, and figure out for myself if I enjoyed it or not.   So if I have my own children I’d like to pass it on, the same way. I don’t want to push my own wants and needs onto my own child, I’d want them to figure that out on their own. So giving them opportunities to try out anything is important. 
<br><br>
>>>How do you want them to grow up?? 
<br><br>
Show them the world. I think its important to remember that America is a melting pot of culture. Everyone is an immigrant from somewhere else, so understanding that and removing that mask of isolationism that America has built over the years is very important. 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
…(Laughs)…just like a comfortable place that I can call my own, um, would be the ideal thing for either the morning or the day. I’m kind of a nomad right now, and I haven’t been in the same apartment for more than 6 months in the last two years…. Moving sucks, I hate moving more than anything else, and I’ve lived in places where I wouldn’t call, well, great places. Currently I feel very grateful for what I have. I think that shelter is a necessity, just a basic need, its so important. Whenever I wake up in my current bedroom and I see a comfortable space, I’m just grateful. 
 </p>
 <br>

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Hmm…I can’t really pin point anything in particular, but I…these last couple of years I’ve become more grateful when I have more full family time.  My family is kind of sprawled across the country right now. Both of my siblings are on the east coast, my parents are a little farther away, in the south bay, and I used to live in Los Angeles. So whenever we got together on a holiday or something, I really enjoyed having those meal times, so...those are happy moments for me. <br><br>

Most frightening? …It’s not like an actual one-time moment but, probably the couple lapses into depression that I’ve faced in the last 5 years. And depression is scary because there is no trigger—there’s nothing that sets it off. And for some reason you feel like…incredibly hopeless, and there’s usually no reason for it. And that’s more frightening than anything. Something that can make you feel so upset with yourself can happen at any given moment. </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Childhood dream…? I think growing up in the ‘burbs it was moving into a city which was so big that I could easily lose myself. I could be one of millions. I’ve lived in a number of cities in the recent past, and it’s really what I prefer. I think…goals for now is to find a neighbourhood or city that really fits what I want, and I’m not sure that San Francisco is really that yet. San Francisco is a great place but there are so many other places that I haven’t visited before, that might be a better fit… Who knows. So just trying to figure that out, and also finding a career path that’s going to satisfy both my financial needs and my career goals is very important. So I think, 3-4 years out of college, it’s not about just finding your first job anymore, but the best fit for you. And that’s where I am right now.  
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell your childhood you? That you have moved to big city??
<br><br>
Yeah, I’ve moved to big city…and its alright!! haha
