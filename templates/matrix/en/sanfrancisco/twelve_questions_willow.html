    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：25　Years in San Francisco：2 years <br>
     <br>Willow was one of my childhood friend Shaun's best friends from High School and college. Such a good friend that, Willow actually spent a few nights at my place in Tokyo when she was visiting because Shaun's dorm wasn't fit for having people over (and thats's putting it nicely haha). Willow is proof that brains and beauty can coexist: her smile dazzling, her ideas inspiring. For the shoot she took me around on her shopping routine in the Filmore area of Pac-Heights, and we had great conversations ranging from new life-hack techiniques she's invented to living the life as a 20 something in this era. Willow is truly has a talnet with words, and her answers were all simply, beautifully, and eloquenty contrived (which made for easier transcribing! Thanks Willow haha) Check out her images (Q.5 & 6) and experiences (Q.11)--all very cool stuff. Will see you soon Willow, lets got meet Papa Shaun!! <br>

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: Right now we’re in Pacific Heights, one of the many amazing neighbourhoods of San Francisco that I call home.  </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 If I had that money I’d probably go to Southeast Asia for a while…just explore, spend time in nature, and if I had a lot of time on my hands, I’d spend it on learning things I’m passionate about, but usually don’t have the time to dive into. 
<br><br>
>>>Can you give one example of something you’re interested in?? 
<br><br>
Yeah, so recently I’m learning design, so I think it would be really cool to be in a place where I could work on that.  
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Hmmm, I don’t think I can answer that question, because e very single place that I go, I find a new part of myself that relates with other cultures. I think that’s the most incredible thing about travel, and that’s why I’m so passionate about it, because I’m able to feel at home pretty much anywhere in the world. So yeah, that’s a tough one for me. 
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
One thing…San Francisco…I would say parks, or maybe Dolores park would be a good example. The weather is always changing but always temperate and amazing, so it’s place where everyone always wants to be outside, picnic, and to be together. Its really nice. 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
   Hmmm…I actually love the American flag. I think its beautiful, its really well designed…I think what it stands for, and what it represents is changing, and maybe not for the best, but that’s just a reflection of our culture. The design itself is really, really beautiful, and I wouldn’t change a thing about it.  </p>
<br>

<br>
<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
…Sand. Just sand. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
…Air. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
…is it an image?? 
<br><br>
>>>It can be anything, the first thing that pops in your mind. 
<br><br>
…Newness. 
<br><br>
>>>…Newness?? 
<br><br>
(Laughs) One word answers right?? I can explain!
<br><br>
>>>Haha no, they’re great. But I do want to hear more about “newness”.
<br><br>
So I think of death as something that is still a mystery to us, and there is so much about it that we still don’t know that when you finally get there, its essentially something new. I mean, its the end of what we know right now, but its the beginning of something else. 
<br><br>
>>>So why “air” for the sun?? 
<br><br>
Whenever I think about the sun, I think about the air that’s around us. 
<br><br>
>>>And why “sand”??
<br><br>
I’ve never been to an ocean without the experience of putting my feet in the sand. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 I think about the future a lot. I think that we all have different ideas about what the future will be for ourselves, personally, but as mankind we don’t really have a unified view of what it will be. I think technology will have a big effect on how the future will unfold and I think the reality is that technology is just a tool that will allow us to go where we’re trying to go, but that we need to grow internally as species, to use those tools the right way—to be able to create something that we believe will be a better future. Because right now, the images we have the future are very dystopian. Everything that you see is about technology taking over. Its not about us using technology to reconnect people, to make things better, which is something I’m really passionate about. 
<br><br>
>>Yeah, especially with the work you’re doing right now. 

</p>
   <br>

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
So…I think…saying what’s the best, or my favourite, or most important thing is very tough question, because I don’t think there is only one answer. I kind of like a lot of things in my life. People would be number one, as it should be (laughs)…the people that I love, my family, my friends, at the end of the day are the most important thing to me. But…yeah, I don’t think this question is one that can be answered so easily. 
</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Um, in a partner…I guess I look for quite a lot of things! (laughs) The first thing is that they’re intelligent and smart…which is the same thing haha. That’s a great answer haha. Very intelligent answer :) No I was going to say intelligent and <i>funny</i>. Someone that can make me laugh, that is really important for me. Someone that can get through the hard times in life, be positive, thats really important if you’re going to be with someone for a long time. 
<br><br>
>>You said there were a lot of things! 
<br><br>
Haha, yeah I could go on and on, but I won’t (laughs) I’ll spare you!
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_questions/willow/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Married Yes, Children Yes, 
<br><br>
Yeah I think…I want to be able to instil a sense of wonder in my kids when I have them. I want to create little people that can see the world as it could be, I guess, and not as what it is. They have the power to change their surroundings, and not have their surroundings change them. That’s definitely what I’d like for my kids. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything you want to do with them?? 
<br><br>
There’s a million things I’d like to do with them!! I’d like to show them the world, I suppose, and teach them about the world. I want to travel with my kids, show them other cultures, other ways of life. I want them to understand that people and things aren’t necessarily as you’re taught, that you can create the world that you live in. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
I think its the same thing. I think its just the person you love. I don’t think there is anything better than waking up next to, and falling asleep next to someone you love. It makes getting out of bed harder (laughs), but it makes the day easier!! 
<br><br>
>>>It makes snuggling in bed a lot longer haha
<br><br>
It does, it makes snuggling in bed A LOT longer haha, but other than that I just like waking up in my room, when the sun is just coming in. Also, I don’t think it really is about what you look at, but how you feel when you wake up. If you wake up feeling excited for the upcoming day, about what you’re going to do, that’s the best feeling you can ever feel.

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Um…(thinks)…I keep coming back to this but, I don’t think I have one happiest moment. I have a lot of incredible moments. When I look back at my life, I don’t look at days, I look at moments. Because you can’t really remember a whole day, you only remember how you felt in particular moments…
<br><br>
>>>Could you give us one of those moments?? 
<br><br>
Yeah…so I took a 20 day trip around the Caribbean, last winter with my friends, and there was this one time when we were on the beach and it was pouring rain, so we just ran and jumped into the ocean. We just swam and played in the water, and the whole experience just felt so surreal, so incredible, and so free. 
<br><br>
>>>Terrifying moment??
<br><br>
…um, there was a moment last summer when a guy with a gun came into our office, and shot a few people on the bottom floor. Kind of a crazy experience where, you never really think that something like that can come to your neighbourhood or your door. We were all kind of paralyzed with this fear. It was just this eye-opening and real moment. We did lose a few people that day, not in my office, but a few people that worked in another office. It was definitely terrifying but it was also…interesting to learn that all those things you see in the news, that happen in the world happen to people just like you. And I think a lot of times when you’re living such a beautiful life, you feel a little bit removed from the things you see on the news, tv, and the people that experience those things are really…well, humanized by that moment when facing adversity.  </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
(Takes a deep breath)…So my childhood dream was to become an astronaut. Um, I still think I have the same dream, I’m still holding on…just kidding, no I’m not haha. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to be an astronaut. I wish. Wait, what was the next part?
<br><br>
>>>What would you tell the childhood you now? 
<br><br>
I would tell her…there’s more to explore than just space. And that you don’t have to…you don’t have to go that far away to make discoveries. That you can still do that. I think that’s what I’d tell her. Because I think the little me would be a little disappointed that I hadn’t made it up there yet haha. Yeah so there are other ways…I think what’s at the core of wanting to become an astronaut is this sense of exploration and discovery, thirst for knowledge about who we are, what we do, and why we do it. I still think I have that, its just I’m doing it in different ways. So that’s what I would tell myself. Keep that. 
<br><br>
>>>And your dream now? 
<br><br>
My dream now…my dream is ever evolving which I think is the exciting part. I’m constantly finding new things that I’m excited about, wanting learn about. So my dream is really to…(thinks)…figure out what I’m best at, and in a way that I can help out the world. Bye Bye!!
