  <div class="title">12 Stops × 12 Animals</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
    <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This is a sub-project where one quantity of 12 is crossed with another quantity of 12 to create representation of that city. In this one, I choose a park I want to visit, get on a train or a bus, go 12 stops, get off, and walk to the rest of the way. While walking, I take photographs of the first 12 animals I see. Hence: "12 Stops × 12 Animals"	</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><em>Route</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I conducted this sub-project after I ate at MyMy's Coffee Shop. I wanted to get to the "Panhandle" section of Golden Gate Park. And here's how it went. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>I got off at the 12th stop, so Baker and California.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/map2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>There weren't too many people (or animals) on baker so I switched onto Divisadero midway through. I also went through Alamo Square. Now lets take a look at what I saw: </p>

    <br>
    <p><em>The Animals!</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>I had to walk a bit before I met my first animal, this dog on the other side of the street.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>On Divisadero, many people were walking dogs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>A lot of couples walking dogs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Case in point. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I liked this dude's dog.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a5.jpg"></p>

    <br>

    <br>
    <p>A LOT of dogs running free in Alamo Sqare.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a7.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Like this dude, really letting them run free!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a8.jpg"></p>

    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a9.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Some dogs even ran my way!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a10.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Like pet, like owner! </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/a11.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally an animal other than a dog. If you look closely, you can see this man carrying his cat!</p>

    <br><br>
    <p><em>After that...</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>After I got to the Panhandle, I saw people forming circles and singing,</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/pan1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>families riding various vehicles,</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/pan2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>and a Grandpa and his walker. Awesome.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/pan3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Lastly I went to the "Bean Bag Cafe" in NOPA,</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/sanfrancisco/twelve_twelve/animals/after1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>and had a Chai. The End!!</p>
    <br>

    <br><br>
    <p><em>FInal Thoughts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>It was very telling that I met so many dogs during this sub-projects because, while I was living in San Francisco, it was the same of this everyday. People love their dogs in this city, and they love walking them. It's just part of the culture. Juicing, jogging, walking your dog. </p>
