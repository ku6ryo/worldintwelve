  <div class="title">12 Steps × 12 Books</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
    <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This is a sub-project where one quantity of 12 is crossed with another quantity of 12 to create representation of that city. In this one, I go to a used bookstore, walk twelve steps from the entrance and find a book case. I choose one book that looks interesting from that case, and proceed onto another one after another 12 steps. I do this until I have found 12 books, then in which I ask either the owner or an employee of the bookstore to choose which one I should buy. Hence: "12 Stops × 12 Animals"</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><em>The Bookstore</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>For San Francisco, I chose "Alexander's Book Company" located downtown near the financial district. </p>

Did Tolstoy really describe Anna Karenina? Did Melville ever really tell us what, exactly, Ishmael looked like? The collection of fragmented images on a page—a graceful ear there, a stray curl, a hat positioned just so—and other clues and signifiers helps us to create an image of a character. But in fact our sense that we know a character intimately has little to do with our ability to concretely picture our beloved—or reviled—literary figures.

The crew drifted for more than ninety days in three tiny whaleboats, succumbing to weather, hunger, disease, and ultimately turning to drastic measures in the fight for survival. </p>
