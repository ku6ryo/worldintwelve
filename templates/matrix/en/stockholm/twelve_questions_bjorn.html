    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：50　Years in Stockholm: 30+ <br>
     <br>  
Bjorn was introduced to me through Carin. Bjorn is and artist, and was super nice showing me around various parts of Sodermalm plus taking me out for brunch. He also invited me to a party where one of his relatives was doing an art show at a restaurant, which also was a unique experience. One thing I really didn’t imagine before I started this project was the vast diversity in age of the people I would meet, and talking with Bjorn really illuminated this fact. It was fun hearing about Stockholm (and Denmark too for that matter) through a different perspective than say the people I met in their 20s, and even the various people I met in their 30s and 40s. Bjorn was every bit what I imagined a Swedish artist to be: intellectual, soft-spoken, and selective of his thoughts and words. For the 12 questions I would recommend his representations (Q.3), children (Q.9), and dreams (Q.12). So Bjorn, thanks again, and I know you’ll come to Japan once more, so until then!! :)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
   Well, I like it. (Laughs) It’s in my neighborhood and I think it’s a very nice place.
<br><br>
>>>It’s a park. What is this place called? 
<br><br>
Ivar Los park.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Oh, I’d go to Tokyo.
<br><br>
>>>Really?
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Again?
<br><br>
Yeah! I wanna go back!
<br><br>
>>>Was that your first time going to Tokyo? That last time?
<br><br>
 No, second. Yeah, but I was in Tokyo 20 years ago now. So…
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I see. Things have changed.
<br><br>
Yeah. Really? To the better, I think. Well, I really liked it. We were there for two and a half weeks. It’s great. Very interesting. 
<br><br>
>>>What would you do? What would you like to do?
<br><br>
(Thinking) Well, what would I like? Well, I like that it’s big. 
<br><br>
>>>Coming from Stockholm.
<br><br>
Yeah.  (Leo laughs)  Yes and I kind of like the pulse, actually. Maybe you’re not so fond of it?
<br><br>
>>>Well, I like, I love Tokyo. I can’t complain.
<br><br>
Yeah? No, but I like the tempo. I like… so many things to see. So very different from being here in many ways. In other ways, it’s very similar. It’s very interesting. Socially, architecturally. Anyway so I would like to go back.




 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Well. (thinking) I know I told you I was half Danish so I guess I have to say Denmark. (Thinking)… Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>You were saying before, Denmark was kind of different?  
<br><br>
Yeah. (Thinking) It’s not so similar, actually. But I guess there’s something in the attitude in Denmark that I like. They’re much more… (thinking)… Maybe they’re not so obedient.  (Both laugh)
<br><br>
>>>Which says something about Sweden. Very interesting. 
<br><br>
But that’s… I mean, why do I want to go back to Japan? Because, I mean, we were talking about this feeling of community, the responsibility. I don’t know. 

</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Like a phenomena or? 
<br><br>
>>>It can be anything. Anything and any place. 
<br><br>
(Thinking)… Well…. I guess, for me, Stockholm at its best, it’s when you walk home on a summer night. That’s really, really beautiful. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s such a cool answer. 
<br><br>
And I don’t know if that’s a thing. Or it’s not a place.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a great. No, it’s a thing. It’s a thing, for sure. Wow. That’s gotta be one of the cooler answers I’ve gotten. What about a place? Is there a place?
<br><br>
A place that Stockholm? (Thinking) Oh, that’s harder. Oh, I don’t have a good answer to that, actually. (Leo laughs)  I don’t know if this is where we are now, is this “Stockholm”? No, not, perhaps. It’s one of the better parts of Stockholm, I guess.
<br><br>
>>>Can you give us a place that you think is a great place to walk back home on a summer night instead?
<br><br>
Yeah. Go, if you walk from the city, you go along Skeppsbron. You know, on the other side of Old Town? That’s great. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that side, right? That’s really beautiful. 
<br><br>
Yeah. And the moon is shining out. Yeah, all the lights and the water. 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
(Thinking) Well. Yeah, being an artist, I should really have an answer, huh? (Both laugh)  Oh, I don’t know. Actually, I’m not too interested in the Swedish flag. I guess it’s okay? The Danish flag is more beautiful. 
<br><br>
>>>Why? 
<br><br>
Red and white, blue and yellow. Well, I like the colors it represents. Sun and sunny sky but… it looks nice, though, against gray sky. I wouldn’t change it.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
(Thinking) The ocean…. (thinking)… Well, I guess we have water right here, but I think of the beach as really, as where I grew up. Southwest Sweden. It’s really long sand beaches. Yeah, that’s it I guess. 
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
(Thinking) Well, I guess it’s the reason we exist here and living in Sweden, as you noticed, it’s really, really a big deal. Kind of sun worshippers here. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s true. Everybody’s in the sun. 
<br><br>
Yeah and now it’s the summer solstice just in a few days. Yeah, it’s midsummer and in the sun. If you’re in northern Sweden, it’s up all night. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death? (Thinking)… Well, I think of my parents and friends. People who don’t live anymore. (Thinking)… Yeah. I also think about life as short. (Thinking).. Yeah, I don’t know and then it’s just black, I guess, when it’s over.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Both? (thinking) Well I’m not too optimistic, really.  (laughs) I think, you know, as a species, we’re so interesting, complicated, and also, I mean, we’re highly intelligent. Can make all this work. Technology and, at the same time, we’re very destructive and stupid. And it’s… (thinking)… something that’s really hard for me to understand. Yeah, I’m concerned, actually. I don’t know how it will end. I have no idea but I hope we’ll find a way to exist. 




</p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/bjorn/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
 For me? Oh, that’s my family. Family and friends. 





</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
>>>So this is, obviously, you’ve found this person. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Well. (Thinking)… Well, yeah. Obviously, I found her and I appreciate her sense of humor. Intellect. (Thinking)… Well, most things about her, actually. But not everything. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, that’s just the way relationships are huh.  
<br><br>
You know? We’ve been together for a while now so you see all things but with all sides of people. But also of course the physical attraction. And no, she’s a wonderful person. 
<br><br>
>>>Thank you. I hope she likes your answer.
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah, I hope! Whew!




  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/bjorn/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

Yeah. Well…. (thinking)… I think I hope we can… (thinking)… how shall I put it? I hope they grow up and feel that we love them and that we care for them. And that they become caring and thinking and… (thinking) I hope I can help them cope with reality and the facts of reality. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow, very interesting…
 <br><br>
You know? And…. (thinking)… Well, I think it was a really good thing to go to Tokyo with our youngest kid.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, really?
<br><br>
Yeah! You know, it was… I guess we were all quite tired with all the impressions, but it was quite a trip, actually. And so much to see and just see that people live in a different context in a different way. I think that’s healthy. 
<br><br>
>>>How was his reaction?
<br><br>
(Thinking)… Well, I think he was pretty amazed by a lot of stuff. All the people and the technology.  The way people behaved. The differences and also the similarities. We made friends, or he made friends, with a Japanese guy in his 50s. Didn’t speak that much English or absolutely no Swedish, but they had their own way of communicating.  Really nice to see. You know, they could understand each other.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
(Thinking)… Well, I guess the perfect start would be waking up and feeling like…today is going to be a great day in the studio. Just have breakfast first and then go to work. And then…I guess I suppose when I was going to bed as well?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, before you go to sleep. 
<br><br>
I guess the feeling that I’ve accomplished something that day. Not only at work, you know? As a human being. I did something good. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow, yeah. So it’s a cycle. The morning and the night is a cycle. 
<br><br>
Well, hopefully I have done something as well. (laughs)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/bjorn/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
When my kids were born. That’s a standard? When you know they’re okay and their mothers as well. It’s a great feeling. I think that’s my best experience, actually. And my worst? (Thinking)… Well. That’s very private. Or personal, maybe I should say? …I guess one very dramatic moment was when one of the kids swallowed a piece of plastic when he was a toddler and almost suffocated. And we had to call an ambulance but he was okay. You know, when some things really happen, you have this intense focus. It’s like your senses are really sharpened and also you have this different perception of time. Goes really slow. And well, this is quite dramatic and at the moment, when it happened, it’s—you don’t think. You just react. But the fear, and all the feelings, they come afterward. I guess that’s my worst moment.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.
<br><br>
But… (Thinking)… I also think of the moment when I understood that my father was dead. That my father had died. 
<br><br>
>>>What do you mean by understood?
<br><br>
Yeah, because he died in an accident and the police called me, and told me they had found a body. That was also when I realized that it had been my father. So that was another really bad moment.
<br><br>
>>>That is terrifying. Was it a car accident?
 <br><br>
No. No, it was a house that burnt down. It was fire. 
<br><br>
>>>…I think we should move on to the next one.
<br><br>
Yeah.




 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
(Thinking) Well, I don’t know if I have a goal like that. If I can keep on working as an artist, I’ll be fine. That’s great. And what would I say to myself?
<br><br>
>>>So your childhood dream was to become an artist?
<br><br>
No, I don’t think I had one. (Thinking)… No, I think I wanted to be a rock star, actually. (Both laugh) Yeah, but I’m too shy.
<br><br>
>>>Oh. There’s probably a few shy rock stars out there? 
<br><br>
Yeah, I know but you have to have some kind of drive too. I played in some bands but it wasn’t really my thing. I’m kind of… I like to sit in my studio and just be all alone. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Not in front of 20,000 people. (laughs)
<br><br>
No, no. And, you know, a friend of mine said “Art is exhibitionism for the shy”. And I think that’s true. You know, you present an object instead of yourself. And what was the last question? 
<br><br>
>>>So what would you tell yourself?
<br><br>
I would tell myself you’ll be okay. You won’t become a rock star but it’ll be okay. (Both laugh)
