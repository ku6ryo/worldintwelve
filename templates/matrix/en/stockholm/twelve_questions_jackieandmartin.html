    <br>
    Place:  <br>
    Martin: So we’re in Vasastan. And it’s… I don’t know. I think really representative of Stockholm. A lot of… just really Stockholm-ish in some way (everyone laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>It’s basically close to where you live, right?
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah.
<br><br>
Martin: It’s close to where we live.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Martin: I can start. I would like to go to Hong Kong.
<br><br>
Jackie: Wow.
<br><br>
>>>That is in China. (Jackie and Leo laugh)
<br><br>
Martin: I’d go to Hong Kong. Eat tasty stuff. Go out to those islands around there. Lie on the beach. And then eat more tasty food. (Jackie laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Always eat tasty food. 
<br><br>
Martin: And just continue doing that, I think.
<br><br>
Jackie: For a month? 
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, that could do.
<br><br>
>>>How about you, Jackie?
<br><br>
Jackie: Me? If I have the money, then I want to go somewhere really different. Well, the place you already kinda have gone, or I mean if I have the money and the time, then I’m going to somewhere really different. Different than my own city. My own life. Oh! I always want to go to Tahiti.
<br><br>
>>>Tahiti? Interesting. 
<br><br>
Martin: Wow. 
<br><br>
Jackie: But do you think 20,000 krona is enough to go?
<br><br>
>>>The plane has been paid for you already. Can you spend 20,000 in a month in Tahiti? Yeah, it’s probably enough.
<br><br>
Jackie: Maybe it’s expensive in Tahiti. 
<br><br>
>>>My other question is do you wanna be in a place for a month, like Tahiti? It’s an island.
<br><br>
Jackie: Why not? 
<br><br>
Martin: What would you do there?
<br><br>
Jackie: Well it’s no small place, right? It’s quite big.
<br><br>
Martin: It’d be really stress free.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, I’m going to walk around. See all the volcanoes, and lie on the beach with seagulls. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>So you’re both lying on the beach. I guess just on different beaches is what it is. (Jackie laughs)
<br><br>
Martin: Oh yeah! 



 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Martin: It’s difficult.
<br><br>
>>>That’s what I said. I told you in the beginning it’ll be hard! 
<br><br>
Martin: I guess… I mean, I could say China but that wouldn’t be really true, would it?  (Everyone laughs) That’s not at all close to me. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting.
<br><br>
Martin: That’s not really me, right?
<br><br>
>>>You only met there?
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, exactly. Just like… how do you put it? A place of “seeing” you know? No? (Thinking)… Feel really close.
<br><br>
Jackie: You mean the city you like?
<br><br>
>>>Anywhere. It doesn’t have to be a city, it can just be anywhere.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, I traveled a little bit in Europe.
<br><br>
>>>Do you feel close to any of those places? 
<br><br>
Jackie: (Thinking)… Wait a minute. Let me think about it.
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Okay, take a minute. Take your time. 
<br><br>
Jackie: You can start.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah. I’m thinking.
<br><br>
>>>So you’re both thinking. So you’ve finally got to the step where China is not the one. (Jackie and Martin laugh)
<br><br>
Martin: Exactly. Exactly. No but I… (thinking)… I don’t think really I like to imagine myself being connected to one other place.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a good answer, too.
<br><br>
Jackie: Connect.
<br><br>
Martin: I guess some people really don’t feel like oh, I want to have some city representing them, you know? I don’t want that.
<br><br>
Jackie: But maybe that’s not what he meant. 
<br><br>
>>>Just feel close to. It doesn’t have to represent you.
<br><br>
Martin: No, that’s true.
<br><br>
Jackie: Hmm…
<br><br>
Martin: If it doesn’t have to be then okay, I can choose one. I can choose Scotland.
<br><br>
>>>The question’s a country but I guess you can say Scotland.
<br><br>
Martin: I mean, it’s different.  (Leo laughs)  Because they do everything else.
<br><br>
>>>I like it. Scotland is your place. Okay. 
<br><br>
Martin: Scotland is my place. Because it’s different than everything I normally do. It’s a separate thing. 
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah. You know? I actually like Barcelona.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, okay.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, it was good weather when I was there. And it was nice food, you know? A lot of tapas and seasonal fresh fruits. It’s a big city as well. You can always walk around. I mean, Stockholm is big but not as big as Barcelona. 
<br><br>
>>>And it fits the Jackie mantra of “I want to be in the Mediterranean”. (Everyone laughs) So I guess that’s okay. I’m glad you’re not making stuff up now. You really like the Mediterranean. (laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie: But is there anyone who doesn’t like Mediterranean?
<br><br>
>>>Good point (laughs) 

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/jackieandmartin/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Martin: Well… (thinking)… Thing and place. 
<br><br>
Jackie: Stockholm? Hm…(thinking)… You know that is actually more simple for me. Because I didn’t live here for so long and I can just say something. I mean it’s not an exact time, but about afternoon. Around this time, five or six, when it’s a really sunny day, so the sun is like this. And this street is like Stockholm. All the people sitting around a table outside, and take a glass of wine, take one glass of beer or eating something.
<br><br>
>>>Very cool.
<br><br>
Jackie: I think it’s the summer time. When it’s nice weather in Stockholm.  (Leo laughs)  Probably not winter time.
<br><br>
Martin: It’s a good time to ask these questions, right?
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah. It’d probably be more difficult for him because he lived here all his life.
<br><br>
>>>All right. It’s your turn now, Martin. 
<br><br>
Martin: Okay. I guess I could ...represents the city? Of course the… I don’t know.
<br><br>
>>>This man’s a thinker.
<br><br>
Jackie: Don’t make it too complicated.
<br><br>
Martin: No, I don’t make it too complicated. I don’t know but different things, right? (Thinking)… Everything is… (Thinking)… Yeah, so. The city is made from different islands and you have bridges connecting everything and you basically have kind of…  It’s really nice to walk around, right?  I don’t know how to explain it. The different parts of the city becomes like small imposters. I know. I know. What was the question again? (Jackie laughs) I feel confused.
<br><br>
>>>What one thing do you think represents the city?
<br><br>
Jackie: Like image or event. Something like memory. “Oh, this is so Stockholm.”
<br><br>
>>>Although your answer sort of answers something. The bridges. The things that connect the islands.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, yeah.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah. But I would like to say it like this. Then what’s represented is this thing that basically divides the city. You can always cross them and go to them. They’re like physically apart, but they also try to get their own image. You want to…. Sweden is a lot about identity, no? You want to say like “oh I’m like this. I’m like that.” Right? And each area will have a really clear path of where and how they want to be. So you have like mental bridges as well as physical ones.
<br><br>
Jackie: Wow.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a good answer! 
<br><br>
Martin: No, but I wanted to reach a good point.
<br><br>
>>>All your thinking came to fruition! 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
Jackie: Hm. (thinking) The flag now, there’s a cross, right?
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah.
<br><br>
Jackie: It has that something to do with the religion?
<br><br>
Martin: In one way, yes.
<br><br>
Jackie: Hmm…
<br><br>
Martin: But the cross is also… you find a cross in a little bit more like a compass. So in a way of saying you’re friends with it.  (Leo and Martin laughs) I like the flag the way it is, I think. But then I have to still say that I don’t think the Swedes use the flag as much as many other countries uses theirs. The flag would need some kind of facelift in order to attract attention, maybe.
<br><br>
Jackie: Sweden is NOT my home country. I don’t have other real points about the flag. I just want to say the color, eh… The colors match. I think it’s nice.
<br><br>
Martin: It’s blue.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, blue and yellow. Also. 
<br><br>
Martin: However, sometimes, they use the wrong yellow.
<br><br>
Jackie: Oh?
<br><br>
Martin: And it doesn’t look as good. 
<br><br>
Jackie: Which color yellow? Not this color yellow.
<br><br>
Martin: It’s like a strong. No, this is more the right kind of yellow. You know sometimes you see like golden yellow? But it’s wrong. It should be like a sun bleached –
<br><br>
Jackie: Like, kind of a pee pee yellow? (Leo laughs)

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Jackie: (Thinking)… Blue!
<br><br>
Martin: Salt? 
<br><br>
>>>Salt? (Jackie laughs) Not salt water? Just salt? 
<br><br>
Martin: Salt.
<br><br>
>>>Like this salt? [Pointing to table salt]
<br><br>
Martin: Like this salt.  (Jackie laughs) Just salt in general, you know? Yeah. Big things. You know? Something big.
<br><br>
>>>Big things. Okay. (Martin laughs) Is there anything else?
<br><br>
Jackie: I don’t know. What I see is a picture of blue color, the sound of the waves, and then the smell of seaweed. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Martin: The sun? Hope. 
<br><br>
Jackie: (laughs) Sounds kind of pathetic! The sun? I think about my eyes who are like this [squints] (Leo and Martin laugh) And then I think about if I used my sunblock! (laughs)  We are from different countries. (laughs)
<br><br>
Martin: Obviously there is a connection to us. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Jackie: Death…. (thinking) Interesting…
<br><br>
Martin: (Thinking)… I don’t know. 
<br><br>
Jackie: Peace. Peace. 
<br><br>
>>>Interesting.
<br><br>
Jackie: It’s not peaceful in a nice kind of way. Just seems… it’s peaceful in another way. It’s quiet. Not turbulent.
<br><br>
Martin: I don’t know. Like, funeral? (laughs) I don’t know. I don’t like to talk about death.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a good answer too. 
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah?
<br><br>
>>>Actually, just one thing. Why “hope” for sun, though? We’re going back.
<br><br>
Martin: It’s actually really obvious.
<br><br>
Jackie: I understand. 
<br><br>
Martin: We have long winters… The sun is hope because you spend a lot of time not having any sun. and it’s darkness and cold. And rain. So yeah, exactly like you said. In Uppsala, there’s this river. And there’s benches and walkways right next to the river.
<br><br>
Jackie: Hey, we were there yesterday. 
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah. The wooden deck. When the first rays of sun and the spring temperatures from the sun and snow starts to melt and that moment, all the Swedes creep out from their caves and begin to hope for a better life.  (Leo laughs) Right? They get all the sun they can and they know it’s… you know? And I mean come on… They date more. They fall in love in spring. All things happen in the spring, right? (Leo laughs) It’s all about that, right?
<br><br>
>>>Yes, it is.
<br><br>
Martin: So there’s a lot of hope. Because the sun is periodical.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Jackie: The future!
<br><br>
Martin: Future is unknown, I think. It’s really unknown.
<br><br>
Jackie: Exactly!
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, yeah.  But that’s what’s fun about it. It’s fun.
<br><br>
Jackie: In the short period, future is bright but then you ask for the mankind. And I read a lot of science fiction when I was in high school. Mankind is doomed! (Jackie and Leo laugh) Yeah, in the long run, of course! 
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, I mean, I’m pretty positive. Positive…hmm I wouldn’t say positive. I’m pretty sure…. Well, I’m pretty sure that I mean, in the future, mankind will have worse than we’re having right now. We’re not going for the better. We’re going for the worse.
<br><br>
Jackie: Wow.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, sure. But then I mean, maybe that perspective, that time isn’t just yet, right? Or it maybe not just for us, no. So I’m still positive. I mean, I’m not on the scale where I need to care. Because I don’t need to care about mankind.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, I mean in Chinese we say “you should do the fun things now.” (Martin and Leo laugh) When you have the chance.
<br><br>
>>>I love Chinese proverbs. Do the fun things now! (Martin laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie:  When you have the chance!
<br><br>
Martin: No, but it’s true because what can you do about it?
<br><br>
>>>Can you say that in Chinese?
<br><br>
Jackie: Oh, to switch my language… [Says proverb in Chinese] Human life is bitter and short. Do the fun things when you have the time. 
<br><br>
>>>What a great quote. Sorry, I interrupted you.
<br><br>
Martin: No, no. I was done.
<br><br>
>>>All right. Great. Is there anything you want to say about Sweden? Or should we just skip Sweden?
<br><br>
Jackie: I would skip it.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/jackieandmartin/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
 Martin: Important thing? Jackie. (Leo laughs) Or are you a thing? Maybe you’re a thing.
<br><br>
>>>Jackie’s a thing.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah? 
<br><br>
Leo: She is. Great.
<br><br>
Jackie: Wow! Is it bad if I don’t say you’re most important? (laughs)
<br><br>
Martin: It’s okay. You don’t need to. You usually don’t. (laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie: I need to follow my feelings. That’s important.
<br><br>
>>>That’s great. 
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah. So I sort of need to do whatever I feel like.
<br><br>
>>>That’s actually a really good answer, because look at where you are now. Obviously, you do a lot of following your feelings.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah. Don’t think too much.  Don’t plan too much.
<br><br>
>>>Now I’m starting to see the late Mr. Jobs… Don’t think, FEEL. (Martin and Jackie laughs)





</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Martin: Just look! (laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie: That’s a boring answer!
<br><br>
Martin: That is a boring answer. No, I mean something here. I mean, life should be fun. If you’re not hanging out with a fun person… Someone you can have some interesting, meaningful life with but also something fun.  There’s no point.
<br><br>
Jackie: Okay.
<br><br>
Martin: I think. Then, Jackie, you’re crazy enough to be funny. (Martin and Leo laugh)
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, I’m kind of crazy. Partner? Yeah, just keep you out from the loneliness, I guess. Yeah.
<br><br>
Martin: Well, thank you.
<br><br>
>>>I feel that could be like… a bear? (Martin laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie: No, no, no. No. That’s the point. Not any other people can keep you out from the loneliness.
<br><br>
>>>See, now we’re getting deep. (Leo laughs) So you’re saying that there are people out there that you could be with together, but still feel lonely. Interesting.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yes…and no. What I meant was, now I’m with him, and I don’t feel lonely anymore. I felt lonely when I was single. So a partner is company.
<br><br>
Martin: Then that’s about you, right? It’s how you feel. Not of your partner. What you look for.
<br><br>
>>>I guess you could sort of put it like “someone that doesn’t make me feel lonely”.
<br><br>
Jackie: But that’s not all. The thing is, just I told you. I followed my feelings, right? It’s not like I do a checklist. Oh, it should be brown hair. It should be about 175 or blah, blah, blah.
<br><br>
>>>He’s a little bit bigger than 175 (Jackie laughs) [Martin is closer to 195 then 175]. 
<br><br>
Martin: I don’t think I would fill all those. (Leo laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie: There’s no checklist, all right? It should be about the feeling. 





  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/jackieandmartin/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

 [Marriage]<br>
Jackie: Yes.<br>
Martin: Sure. Sure.  Marriage is good.
<br><br>
[Children]<br>
Jackie: Yeah. I was thinking like right now, if you travel and do fun things… I like to travel around. I have a lot of countries on my list as you can see, right? But I don’t think it will be fun if I still do this when I’m 50. 
<br><br>
>>>True.
<br><br>
Jackie: So probably it’s smart to have a child or maybe two. Later.
<br><br>
Martin: It’s like having kids is the greatest hobby of them all, you know? (laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>That’s a pretty good quote. (Jackie laughs)
<br><br>
Martin: No, but yes. You need to have something to do when you get old. If you don’t have kids then this… I mean. It’s something to do. I think. So sure. Yeah.
<br><br>
[Second part of question]<br>
Jackie: Not really. 
<br><br>
Martin: Free. Really free. Get to do whatever they want in some aspect.
<br><br>
Jackie: I was thinking not super free. 
<br><br>
Martin: (laughs) It’s good for some kids and not others…
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah, I mean you provide a proper education for a kid, right? It’s not like the kid has to be smart and study all the time but if they don’t have the intelligence, later, probably, they’ll realise it’s good to have an education.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, and I mean maybe it’s our way of becoming free. Free, for example, it’s difficult to be free if you don’t have money or intellect or something like that, right? So sometimes you need to force… I mean, it could be good to tell someone to learn something one time because they will benefit from it later.
<br><br>
>>>We’re getting some real answers here. This is really good. (Jackie laughs) Is there anything you want to do, specifically want to do? 
<br><br>
Martin: Do with them? Not really.
<br><br>
Jackie: Me either.
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) They’ll just be there. They’ll be your hobby.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah. I mean, you’ll be forced to. Once you have them. So I don’t think there’s anything specific. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Jackie: Light! Like the sunlight.
<br><br>
Martin: Light and the feeling of not having pressure. Not that feeling “oh, I need to go off and work”.
<br><br>
Jackie: To catch the train! (laughs)
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah, yeah. I mean, the feeling where you get up and you’re motivated. Not thinking about doing hard work, but you should want to wake up. Should feel exciting.
<br><br>
>>>You should want to get up. That’s a cool way to put it.
<br><br>
Martin: Because sometimes it is like that, right? You really feel like, “wow!” You know? Same thing with getting to bed. If you go to bed because you’re too tired, but you want to keep on being up, it doesn’t feel good.
<br><br>
Jackie: I want to feel like I have done all the things I was supposed to do before I go to bed. I set my alarm. I brushed my teeth and everything. I did my laundry. 
<br><br>
>>>Would that be the feeling that you finish? Has it fulfilled your –
<br><br>
Jackie: Day. Yeah.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/jackieandmartin/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Jackie: (Thinking)… Well, it’s not difficult. I can think of a lot of moments.
<br><br>
Martin: Terrified of ghosts. (laughs)
<br><br>
Jackie: That was not the worst one. I rarely have bad dreams but it was one time, I had a bad dream. I think it was monsters or ghosts in my dream. Then I woke up. I actually woke up in the middle of the night from my bad dream.
<br><br>
>>>It’s like a movie!
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah!
<br><br>
>>>You’re actually like, “ah!”
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah! But that’s the scariest thing, because if you woke up from dreams you actually remember all the things, and then it was still dark. I didn’t even dare to open my eyes. What if I opened my eyes? Then I see those things I saw in my dream. So it was like, “Aaaaah!”
<br><br>
>>>That’s crazy! So you woke up and didn’t open your eyes?
<br><br>
Jackie: I didn’t dare! (Martin laughs) The thought was too scary! And then well, luckily enough, I fall asleep back again. So that’s most terrifying moment. 
<br><br>
Martin: It’s good that it’s an imaginary scary thing, right?
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah.
<br><br>
Martin: That’s good. That’s good. Yeah, what could be the most? (Thinking)
<br><br>
>>>You can go on with your happiest.
<br><br>
Jackie: Happiest? Oh, there are many. I cannot figure out which one is most happy.
<br><br>
>>>Right. I guess it’s Martin’s turn, then. You can answer one of them.
<br><br>
Martin: I think leaving China. Going on a plane back to Sweden. That felt really terrible.
<br><br>
>>>That felt terrible?
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Why is that?
<br><br>
Martin: Because you go… I took one year off, and I studied. And we’re supposed to see those things, right? But then I knew I also needed to go back. I had unfinished business in my home country, right? But then you’re so unsure what is going to be left with the whole China thing. Jackie, and all the things I did there. That was scary.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. Now that we’ve gotten terribles out of you, happiest now.
<br><br>
Jackie: I didn’t think that was scary. I mean, there was hope, right? It was not totally bad? But probably it was bad for you.
<br><br>
Martin: Very.
<br><br>
Jackie: Okay.
<br><br>
>>>I guess the feeling of uncertainty is always not a happy feeling. So.
<br><br>
Jackie: That’s kind of true.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah.
<br><br>
Leo: [The waitress starts putting chairs inside next to our table] I think we’re going to have the store closing on tape? On tape? Soon? (Martin laughs) And happy moments?
<br><br>
Martin: Happy moments? I don’t know! First batch of beer. That’s good.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a good answer. I’ll be talking about that probably when I introduce you. So it’s good that you brought that up. Okay. When was that? 
<br><br>
Martin: In Uppsala. We made, just experimenting. Being super nerdy about the technical brewing things. And then the feeling of how that escalated, you know? Going from basically something in the kitchen all the way to the barn in Gotland. 
<br><br>
>>>It’s like your baby.
<br><br>
Jackie: Yeah. I have a lot of happy moments. I got a visa to Sweden. I got an offer to Uppsala University. When I was making progress in my life. Then I felt happy.

<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Martin: I didn’t have a childhood dream, I think.
<br><br>
>>>You never said “I want to become this when I grow up?”
<br><br>
Martin: No. I was just playing and being totally into my… I don’t know. All the games I was playing. 
<br><br>
>>>I’ve had a number of people who don’t have one. So what would you tell your kid now? What would say?
<br><br>
Martin: Part of the thing, I think, I never… I mean some people really are so strongly, they feel they have some path thing to go on. And I think I would tell my kid not to…. I mean, just continue what you’re doing, you know? Because it’s fun not to know. Not to have a path.
<br><br>
Jackie: Hmm.
<br><br>
>>>Interesting because you also said the uncertainty part of coming back to Sweden was a terrible feeling.
<br><br>
Martin: Sure. It’s a conflict. 
<br><br>
>>>Aha. There’s always a conflict.
<br><br>
Jackie: (Laughs) When I was a child and reading science fiction, I was thinking hm, when I grow up, I’m going to write science fictions as well. (laughs) But it’s not exactly what I’m doing now, but yeah. I want to tell the child me, it’s good to dream. It’s nice to have a dream and you never know. It probably will come true.
<br><br>
>>>All right. And what are your goals or dreams now?
<br><br>
Jackie: My dream? Now? I don’t have super big dream now but I have some short ones. I want to go to London.
<br><br>
>>>Get your visa.
<br><br>
Jackie: (Laughs) I don’t think that’s super hard. 800 krona [Swedish currency], then you get it. Yeah, short plans. Yeah. Like plans in the short term. 
<br><br>
>>>Anything other than going to London?
<br><br>
Jackie: I was thinking maybe I should get a driver’s license. (Martin and Leo laugh)
<br><br>
Martin: Nice.
<br><br>
>>>These are very tangible, realistic goals, I must say.
<br><br>
Martin: That’s nice what you do.
<br><br>
Jackie: Okay! Maybe that’s not a dream. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>(laughs) It’s a goal, which is also good too.
<br><br>
Jackie: Oh! I know. I want to go to Tahiti. That can be a dream.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that’s very true. If you got your month, then that’s what you’re going to do.
<br><br>
Martin: Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>All right. Let’s finish it off, Martin.
<br><br>
Martin: Well, I think…
<br><br>
>>>Become the biggest brewery in Stockholm? (Laughs)
<br><br>
Martin: No, no! Just continue. Try to… I don’t know. Try to do research. And I hope that works out in some way, too. It would be fun to live other places than Stockholm.
<br><br>
>>>Oh yeah. I heard a bit from Jackie yesterday.
<br><br>
Martin: It would be really cool to have an easier way. Not just going to London… How do I put it?
<br><br>
Jackie: A trip.
<br><br>
Martin: A trip. But having a reason to go there. Go there a longer time for work and maybe being able to have the possibility that you could find work as well there.
<br><br>
Jackie: That sounds cool.
<br><br>
Martin: Becoming more international.
<br><br>
>>>That’s an interesting goal, yeah. 
<br><br>
Martin: To be able to disconnect from one location.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. I think we’ll finish it at that, huh?
<br><br>
Martin: Sure. (Jackie laughs)
<br><br>
>>>To be able to disconnect from one location. T-shirt quote, here we come! (laughs)
