    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：28　Years in Stockholm: 9 <br>
     <br>  
  Lina was introduced to me through Asuka. I met Lina a couple of times, once when she invited me to a midsummer party hosted by a digital marketing company, and the second time when we had lunch at a park near her work (and did the questions). Lina is my defining image of a cool Swedish young person living in Stockholm; she’s smart, has educated opinions, is cultured, and is super friendly. Yeah, its hard to beat! Talking with her on both occasions was great (I still remember our conversation on relationships lol), but the way she answered the questions were really revealing too. Having that unbiased, objective sense of Sweden and its position in the world, it’s just something you don’t see in many other people. So yeah, I highly recommend reading all her answers, but if I were to choose, it would be the images (Q.5), the future (Q.6) which is fascinating, marriage/children (Q.9), and the moments (Q.11). So Lina, thanks for all your hospitality, and I will definitely see you again! Come to Tokyo, or maybe in New York…??

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  This is Humlegården, the park in the middle of Stockholm. It's close to my work, and I usually go here for lunch. 
<br><br>
>>>What you're doing right now! 
<br><br>
Exactly! 


  </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/lina/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Tricky question. I mean, I would like to go to Brazil and hang out in different cities there, but Rio de Janeiro sounds like a lot of fun. I want to go there during the Carnival, though. That's been something I've wanted to do for years, but I'm always thinking it's going to be too expensive to go. So. 
<br><br>
>>>I see. So, you want to go to Rio, then. 
<br><br>
Yep. And the places that interest me because of the different population there, and, I mean, the nature…it seems beautiful. The culture is rich. 
<br><br>
>>>I was there. (Laughs) And it is, yeah. It was incredible. 
<br><br>
That's what I've heard. So, it's like a dream. 
<br><br>
>>>Alright. Sounds good. An attainable dream being you're living in Sweden and just got to get your days off in February. 
<br><br>
Yeah. It's all good. Yeah... I guess I could. At my job, I could. But then I would have no vacation time in the summer time. (Laughs)



 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 America. Because, I mean, I lived in…I don’t know if that’s a fair answer, but I lived in New York for a year, and I've been there plenty more. And I haven't been outside New York state. So, I know that's not representative of all of America, but that's the only place I've lived in for a longer time. 
<br><br>
>>>It’s true. New York is definitely not the representation of the United States, but that works. New York. 

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/lina/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I mean, this park is pretty brilliant, I think. Just the benches around us. Like, everyone is sitting on their own bench. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Good point!! 
<br><br>
It's a sunny day. Everyone comes out to the park. Swedes love the sun. We don't get much of it. I'm guessing, or I'm thinking that all parks is a good representation of Swedes. As soon as the weather is fine, we're here every hour of the day, especially in the sun. Can I name another thing? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah! 
<br><br>
I'd say the "uteservering", the out-door servings?
<br><br>
>>>What is it? 
<br><br>
In restaurants or bars, when you open up the place where you can sit outside? 
<br><br>
>>>Oh for the outdoor eating in the plazas. 
<br><br>
Yeah, that's where people eat as soon as it's a little bit warmer... We have a heavy drinking culture here as well. People get really drunk on Fridays and Saturdays and also during summertime. People drink all the time. It's a big... I mean sadly enough it's a big part of our culture. It helps us relax. So, when people are off during their monthly summer vacation, they're drinking every day more or less. 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
I mean, I would. I like the simplicity of the flag. It's just the cross in the middle, but I would like it to be more colorful since Sweden is actually changing, a lot. We have a big issue with racism here. So, I would like the flag to be more including, I think. So, keep the simple pattern, but make it more colorful and diverse. 
<br><br>
>>>So get rid of the blue in the middle? 
<br><br>
Yeah! (Laughs) It represents the ocean and the big fields or whatever. 


 </p>

<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/lina/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
(Laughs) Okay. 
<br><br>
—The Ocean  <br>
I’m thinking about Frank Ocean. (Laughs) No, just kidding (laughs). I see the West Coast where I used to go with my parents. 
<br><br>
>>>West Coast of Sweden. 
<br><br>
Yeah. It's just more homey. We used to go. We have a house there. So, we used to go there in the summertime. But I see the beach, and I see the ocean. And the sun. Stuff like that. So, you see the big…like, it leads to nothingness. That's what I think of, just childhood memories. 
<br><br>

—The Sun <br>
speaker 1: Back to what I said before. Swedes love the sun. But image-wise… that's difficult. I don't know. (Thinking)
<br><br>
>>> Nothing that pops to your mind. 
<br><br>
Like an image? Song. (Thinking) I mean, everything has to do with the sun. I immediately think of Swedish… old Swedish popular songs like... 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, interesting! 
<br><br>
Sun in Sweden is... When I hear sun I think about summer. It's so connected with summer and nothing else, basically, because six months a year it's completely black. Pitch black, like dark…it's dark a lot here. So, summertime, like I said, because the sun doesn't set much here. So, it makes me think of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlhY1WEAH8U"> “Sommaren är kort”</a> by Tomas Ledin. You can listen to it. (Laughs) 
<br><br>

—Death <br>
Ingmar Bergman made a film. 
<br><br>
>>>Who made a film? 
<br><br>
Ingmar Bergman. He's from Uppsala. Made a film with a scene where this person meets this other person, Death. So if you say Death, I'm thinking about this character that he's playing. I can't remember what movie it is, though. I can find it for you. 
<br><br>
 >>>We'll find it when this goes up. All right. Great. <i> [The movie is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seventh_Seal">“The Seventh Seal”</a>]</i>
<br><br>
So, I view Death as this person, basically.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Just regular thoughts? Most of all, I'm feeling worried. Hmm…not just talking about… not just Sweden. Everywhere. You’d think in 2015 we'd be somewhere else with regards to sexism, racism, social... the class differences. Everything that's bad about society is just getting worse, I think. …In some ways, yeah, people are getting more and more educated, but people are also getting more and more stupid. So, yeah, that worries me a lot, actually. Where are we going? How can people understand simple things like how to just take care of each other? In Sweden, we have this party called the Swedish Democrats. They say they're not racist, they’re not this and that, but they basically don't want any more people to be let in Sweden. And it's so fucked up. To me, it's so fucked up. How can you think that when people are running from war and stuff? They have nowhere to go. How can you be so selfish? We're sitting here. We have one of the world's best lifestyles. The gap between rich and poor here is so tiny. The standard for us is so good, and we don't want to share any of that. It's so…I mean, beyond egoistic. You can't put yourself in anyone else's shoes just because you're born in a country -- it doesn't make sense. 
<br><br>
And talking about racism in America, for example, how Black people are still getting treated...or, not just Black people, but everybody not perceived as white or whatever. That's so weird that we're not... We don't have more knowledge about this yet. That concerns me a lot. To the future, yeah. That concerns me. 
<br><br>
>>> Do you think this has to do with... well being here for a while, I feel like everything in Sweden, from the law to customs, are based heavily around the concept of equality.
<br><br>
Equality, but, still, people don't know that we're racist in this country, and that's how racist we are. 
<br><br>
>>>Very very interesting. 
<br><br>
We're always waving the Swedish flag and saying we're so good and it's equal between men and women, we're so equal. And that's so much bull. That's bullshit. Women still earn a lot less than men. We don't have the same rights, basically. So, it's ridiculous to say that we're so good when we still have a long way to go. And then people are usually like, "We have it so much better than so and so country,” but that doesn't matter if we're not equal. There's still a big difference between being...well, speaking Swedish fluently and if you don't, or you're a woman or you're a man or you're disabled. All of these things. Homosexual or heterosexual. It's still not equal. So, I don't think we should brag about anything until we are. 
<br><br>
>>> Wow… Wow. (Lina laughs)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/lina/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
 …Family? Which includes friends and yeah. (Laughs) People. I mean, the most important thing for me is having healthy relationships, I think. 





</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
>>>We talked a little about this before, huh, at the party. 
<br><br>
(Laughs). Putting this in. I can't remember what we talked about! (Laughs). What’s important in a partner for me is...I'm thinking of the obvious stuff. Umm…I need my partner to be loyal. I need to be seen and heard. 
<br><br>
>>>Seen and heard. What do you mean by that? 
<br><br>
Like anything. It's like, for example, if my work is important to me, then that's important. You know? 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, I see. 
<br><br>
Like you need to be taken seriously. Or if I...my needs are...(laughs) someone cares about it, you know? (Laughs)
<br><br>
<i>[Note: Cute little Swedish children are playing soccer in the background, and Lina and Leo get distracted] </i>
<br><br>
Yeah, so I think number one might be to have fun with your partner. 
<br><br>
>>>That is a very basic thing. 
<br><br>
Even though you're struggling with shitty circumstances in your relationship, the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy time with each other. 
<br><br>
>>>Very true. 
<br><br>
I've been in relationships where I've been really in love, and I really want to be with the person, but I know...I really know that I'm not having such a good time. We don't do the same things, but you still can't really control your emotions. Do you know what I mean? When you actually break up, it's like “that was so boring”. You know? Like, you didn't talk to me the way I want to talk. 
<br><br>
>>> Wow, yeah. That's a very fundamental thing not many people talk about. 
<br><br>
Yep. 




  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/lina/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

 >>>This is interesting because in Sweden a lot of people don't get married. 
<br><br>
But a lot of people do now. 
<br><br>
>>>A lot of people do get married too. 
<br><br>
Because it's trendy now, to get married young, but I don't think so. I don't care about that. It might be for practical reasons sometime, but otherwise, I don't really see the purpose of that. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you want children, though? 
<br><br>
Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>So now back to the original question. This was given to me by a pregnant friend who has now successfully given birth. 
<br><br>
Congratulations to her. I think that…(thinking)… I don't know. I think I just relate it to my own childhood. I grew up super, super safe with my mom, my dad, and my brother. Really loving, safe home. So I think I'm just like recalling that as super nice, you know? So, you know, what I can remember is…I enjoy cooking. 
<br><br>
>>>Cooking! 
<br><br>
Yeah, we did that with Mom and Dad during weekends and stuff when we had more time. You know, it's, like, Saturday. Friday and Saturday we always made a nicer dinner. Things like that. 
<br><br>
>>>Cozy Fridays! [A Swedish saying]
<br><br>
Yeah. (Laughs) Cozy Fridays. The Swedish concepts. Taco Fridays. I don't know. I mean, it's also dangerous… because why would you get, why do you want kids? Is it just an extension of yourself? Is it just too... is it because people will be like, "Oh, I never felt love before until I had kids.”  And then it's like “That's pretty sad.” (Leo laughs) And then it's like “Okay, so you're only producing kids to have unconditional love in your life?” But I think they give you so much love it's hard not to want them. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow, that's a nice quote at the very end. (Lina laughs) 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Before I wake up, it would be… the sun actually. To see the weather is pretty. My boyfriend calls me Weather Girl because I'm like, "Oh it's gonna be nice weather this weekend." Or, "Oh, it's gonna rain." I always check because it makes a big difference in how I'm gonna feel if the weather is good or bad. But, also, like I said earlier, four months out of the year it's pitch black. 24 hours. So, it's really depressing, really hard to wake up when it's really really dark outside. So yeah, that's what I want to see: the sun. And, before I go to bed, I want to see someone I love.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
I think it was when I got my internship in New York, actually. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh, wow, interesting. 
<br><br>
Because its was like… I was kind of lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. And then, I was, like, I started going back and forth to New York. And I was falling in love with the city, basically, because everyone has done that. And then I was at this school Sweden, and it's everywhere, but it's called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hyperisland.com/">Hyper Island</a>. And I knew that this was a good school. That you can get a cool job with this, or whatever. So then I was like “Okay, I'll just try this, and through this school I can go back to New York.” So that was the first time in my life that I had a long-term goal. So two years before I went to New York, I was planning on this. And then there was just a tiny part left, and that was to get the internship in New York. I needed a paid internship, and I wanted a longer one. And I got a year's internship that was fully paid and everything. So, for me, that was proof of… I knew I could do it. For me, I knew I could do it. If you set your mind to it, you can do it. I was super happy. Mostly, this was what I wanted to accomplish, and I did. 
<br><br>
>>>Do you have a terrifying moment? 
<br><br>
Terrifying moment... No. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>No terrifying moment. That's good too. 
<br><br>
No, the terrifying moment was the first time I was actually going to New York. And I worked at this office here that I showed you. The architecture firm. I hated my job. I was only there for 1 1/2 months, but I had this coworker who I was working close to. And she was a nightmare. I couldn't do anything right. And… in just 4 weeks, I was so depressed. I didn't know what I was doing. I couldn't function, basically. 
<br><br>
>>>That's a terrible person.
<br><br>
Yeah, and, in this time, I met a guy who was here for 2 weeks, and he was moving to New York. We fell in love in, like, 2 weeks, and then he moved to New York. And then I quit my job, and then I went to New York just for a break. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh.  
<br><br>
And that was a terrifying moment in my life because I was at the bottom of everything. I didn't have an apartment, I didn't have a job. I barely had any money. And I didn't know what to do next, you know? I was in this shitty, shitty place. And, also, this person made me feel so bad about myself. So that was a terrifying decision. 
<br><br>
>>>That's actually very cool…cool as in when you look back on it. 
<br><br>
But it was super bad at the time, but the best thing I could do for myself. And after that, obviously, it took a while, but it was a slow way back. But the way back was applying for the school, all that, and it happened very slowly, but when I got back on track it's amazing. You know? It's like you need to be at the bottom sometimes to get up, and I did after I got the internship and everything. Got into the school, and everything's better.



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
I think when I was a kid, you're dreaming about other things because, when you're a kid, you live so much in the moment, and when you get knowledge you get more worried and all this bad stuff on ourselves. When you're a kid, you're just like, "Oh, I would like to be this or that." But I think my dream was to do something… that I (Laughs) thought was fun. I remember wanting to be a chef because I like to cook and being a police officer because that's doing good for the world or whatever. I don't know what I would tell myself, though, because it's just like happiness.  
<br><br>
>>> So you won't tell anything. Just stand there and watch. 
<br><br>
Just keep… Yeah, whatever, but I could tell her that “you can do anything you want to do”. You just have to work hard. That's something I know now. 
<br><br>
My dreams now are just to live a happy life, to work at something that is stimulating to me, and… But I also care about what I said before -- the most important thing is relationships for me. I mean, we spend more time at work than with family and friends. So, work also has to be very good. I mean, I would never be satisfied with anything I don't like. So, if it's shitty, I would move on.
