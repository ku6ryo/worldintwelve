    <p><span class="name">Maja Fyfe</span></p>
    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：40 (but 20 at heart :)　Years in Stockholm: 3 <br>
     <br>  
    Maja was introduced to me through Enni, where they both met at the Swedish language school (run by the government, naturally), as new citizens of Sweden. Maja is a mother of two, and working at the national TV and radio station in Stockholm. Talking with Maja was one of those situations I’ll remember for a long time; personally experiencing situations where countries have gone through war, immigration (a hot topic in Europe as of Sept. 2015), and financial collapse, her life history is just so incredibly different from any person so far. Details will come in her 12 Questions, but I was just aghast throughout the interview. I had read and thought about such situations, and these were significant reasons for me starting this project, but hearing personal stories was on a completely different level. For the answers, I recommend the future (Q.6), partner (Q.8), moments (Q.11). and dreams (Q.12). So Maja, thanks again for taking time out of your day, and please do bring your sons to Japan one day! That’ll be another adventure haha

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  My workplace and I actually always dreamt to work for radio, television or university, then it actually came true here.
<br><br>
>>>In Stockholm! 
<br><br>
Swedish radio, and we just actually celebrated 90 years of existence, a very cool place, one of the biggest media companies in Sweden, so it’s very cool to work here.  
<br><br>
I work as HR business partner, supporting managers in all HR-related questions, so that’s my profession.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 I think I would go somewhere nice in Italy, Florence or yes.  I’ve been already to Florence, but I definitely would go back.  Or maybe Venice, which I haven’t been.  I love Italy.  It’s just beautiful architecture, beautiful cities, enjoyment, weather<br><br>
>>>Okay, great, but you’d take your family?
<br><br>
Yeah, why not, sometimes I can even go myself.  It doesn’t matter.  [laughs]



 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 Yeah, Bosnia is always in my heart and that’s my country, but the closest to, let’s say Ireland because my husband is Irish.  I had both of my children in Dublin.   I have a lot of friends there and family, and I just love Irish people.  They’re very open, friendly.  Ireland, yes.

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/maja/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
One thing and place?  I have many.  As I said, I really adore Stockholm.  There’s so many things to do.  I’ve been living here three years, but every weekend kind of feels like holiday, “let’s explore something else”.  I’d say Stadshuset.  I like that area.  It’s a city hall.  For example, that represents one of the landmarks of Stockholm… so that’s let’s say if you want one place, but also of course, the old town.  It’s beautiful, but if you pick a landmark, that area of city hall, yeah.  I like that, it represents Stockholm.
<br><br>
>>>Do you think there’s a thing?  That would be the place, right?  Do you think there’s one thing you can say 
<br><br>
 Thing about Stockholm…Fika!! Lovely coffee and lovely people taking it easy and having a nice life.

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
 Is it my place to do it?  [laughs] Now, if I could--well, it’s right now, it’s blue with yellow cross.  Maybe we change it to look like a yellow sunshine rather than a cross.  That’s the first thing on my mind.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a cool idea! (laughs)
Sweden is mixed and there are lots of different cultures out here, so it would then reflect the country as it is. Happy, sunny, something like that.  
<br><br>
>>>The Swedish adore the sun because they don’t get enough of it.
<br><br>
 Exactly, and the blue is kind of like a nice blue sky when it comes out.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean -- calmness, I don’t know, relaxation.  I like water and my horoscope sign is the cancer, so I’m a water--I’m always attracted to water and I always feel relaxed by the ocean, by any water body. 
<br><br>
>>>Stockholm. 
<br><br>
Yes, a lot of it.  
<br><br>
>>>Dublin.
<br><br>
It’s on the sea, it’s on the sea and it has a river.
<br><br>
>>>London has a river.  Pittsburgh, not really…??
<br><br>
Yes, three rivers, massive ones, yeah -- Ohio. Three rivers… and actually the river, Ohio, comes together by two rivers in Pittsburgh, very nice.
<br><br>
>>>Sarajevo.
<br><br>
Sarajevo, yeah, small, miserable, small river, [laughs] but we still love it.  It’s in our hearts. [laughs]
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
SPEAKER2: Sun -- warm. Warmth. Energy.  Yes, the source of life.
<br><br>


—Death <br>
SPEAKER2: Yeah, fear.  I’m afraid of it.  It’s darkness, don’t like thinking about it, talking about it, but it’s the only truth in a way for all of us, which scares me.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
>>>This is very interesting…especially thinking of where you come from. 
<br><br>
When you come to this stage, when people say mid-life crisis, you do try to question “oh my god, what have I done?  Oh, the youth is gone, what’s coming ahead?”  You feel changes in your body.  You become more tired.  You feel “oh, my back hurts...oh my god, everything is going downhill from here.”
<br><br>
These are the questions that I had in mind last year when I was 40, but now you kind of think “okay, but you need to look ahead and try to make the sense of your life”.  And what I figured, I think it’s best to try to live in the moment every day.  Take one day, look forward to little things.  Because if you try to think about big picture a lot, then you get “oh, god…” you’ll get depressed.
<br><br>
Trust me, when I was younger I never thought about it, but now at this stage, you do.  So it’s best to take one little step at a time.  Focus on happy, little things in your life every day and little things to look forward.
<br><br>
>>>Wow that’s really interesting…do you have an image for just in general, for humankind?
<br><br>
 Oh, humankind -- doomed.  [laughs]
<br><br>
>>>Oh, that’s too bad!! 
<br><br>
Yeah, because you see news and you see horrible things, you sometimes lose faith in humanity.  I just pray though that maybe it will be alright. I come from Bosnia, where I was born.  There was a lot of injustice, people suffering.  It’s repeating and repeating itself all the time.  Corruption, politicians —I’m not optimistic.  That’s my opinion.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
My family. No. 1 are children.  I know it’s a cliche, but that’s how it is.  One day maybe you’ll see.  It really is...you prioritize it. It comes above everything.





</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
I think very important thing is that you click and be yourself with that person, and you know straight away that you met somebody that you don’t need to pretend anything.  You don’t need to be anybody else.  When I met my husband, I was myself straight away.
<br><br>
>>>So upon first contact. 
<br><br>
Yeah, you just feel yourself.  …we clicked on many levels.  And the way you know if you’re going to marry somebody, you just know -  you have common view in many things -- “how are we going to raise children?" for example.
<br><br>
My husband is Catholic, from Northern Ireland, and I am a Muslim from Bosnia—so it’s crazy.  [Both laugh] These days, you don’t hear things like that.  It was very important that we think the same -- “hey, who cares, we’re all human beings, we’re all one and we all have the same god.  Who cares if we don’t do this or that”.  We raise our children to be proud of who they are and they can choose whatever they want, but we’re not going to impose anything on them...
<br><br>
So that’s important that these important matters, you click, you agree on things, what you’re gonna do, view of life.  Otherwise, there are gonna be problems later.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/maja/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

  Oh yeah, be happy.  You know – do what they want, as long as they are happy.  Of course, you can’t have it all, but wouldn’t it be nice if he’s wonderful scientist, he studies hard, that he reads, you want him to be...and sometimes you project, of course, every parent, that “oh, maybe what I haven’t or you say ..oh it seems he got my bad handwriting, oh no” (Leo laughs).   Things like that, you have to stop yourself and you have to let go.  You have to let them become who they want to be… but happiness, their own happiness.  That’s most important I think.  Happy.
<br><br>
>>>Could you share with us how you met your husband? 
<br><br>
Yes, he came on the fourth year of my university, on my fourth year.  See, remember I told you I had a scholarship, and yeah, so he came with a group of exchange Irish students in my senior year, and we met there.  It was November 1996, and ooh, long time ago, but yeah, we start our relationship and the rest is history.
<br><br>
>>>So cool.  It’s so cool to think that America can connect someone from different worlds.
<br><br>
Exactly, it’s crazy.
<br><br>
>>>America still has something going for it.  [laughs]



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Right now, I’m stressed when I wake up and I don’t like this, and I’m fighting.  I really hope I can change it…  That’s what, I would just like to wake up and think…who cares.
<br><br>
>>>No stress.
<br><br>
Yes, yes, and right now it’s not like that and it’s tough.  I used to wake up much more relaxed 20 years ago, 15 years, but now, no.  I don’t know what’s going on.
<br><br>
>>>What about before you go to sleep?
<br><br>
Hmmm… what feeling I would love is actually to just fall asleep, because right now, you’re mind is [thinking noise] also.  It takes me--I told my husband, “god, we have to go to bed at 9:00, 10 o’clock.  By the time we manage to fall asleep it will be about 11:00” because there’s just things going through your mind.  And I would just love that feeling as a child, you were exhausted after playing.  You just hit the pillow and you’re asleep.  This is what I want.
<br><br>
Actually, to think of nothing, but just boom!—It happens sometimes, when you’re on holidays or something.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Happiest, I would say you can’t say one, let’s say when your children are born.  It’s actually mixed feeling in your life—“what the hell just happened?” (Leo laughs) You’re exhausted, but there was one moment when my first child was born, when you have a baby right here, the warmness of the baby and you cannot--I cannot describe to you, but that’s wonderful.
<br><br>
>>>What was the most terrifying? Anything you can share with us?
<br><br>
Well, I’m trying to think because there are obviously the times, yeah, during early ‘90s when the war was happening.  And for example, you watch CNN and I remember particularly there was a massacre in Sarajevo at a marketplace, where there was about 60 people there, and bodies.  And I’m watching the news and I knew it could be my family there because they live five minutes away.
<br><br>
And you don’t know.  And that “not knowing.” --I remember my friend ringing me, “I have the list of dead people.”  I just couldn’t, I said “ohhhhhh”, I started screaming.  My roommate said “okay, it’s okay, don’t…”  
<br><br>
>>>War…
<br><br>
Yeah, these moments like that.
<br><br>
>>>These are pretty strong answers… the happiest moments are birth and the most terrifying moments are war.
<br><br>
Yeah, war and not knowing, and of course, always worrying you now, about your child, of something happening.  <br><br>
>>>Wow.
<br><br>
I don’t like flying either, so every time I take off, I’m...I think it’s my last time. [laughs]
<br><br>
>>>So that’s the second, flying.(laughs)
<br><br>
Flying, oh my god, take-off, yes, take-off every time. [laughs]  I think something’s gonna happen.



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Yeah, it’s hard because I’ve never--some kids know exactly “oh, I want to be that.”  And I don’t know, that’s a tough one to answer because I don’t have anything in particular.  I suppose I wanted to be happy.  I always cared about my family and that we’re always together and things like that.  …So yeah, I never as a child could dream of what actually happened in my life.  I always thought it would be more predictable -- my home, and my family, and my town and all that, and being happy.
<br><br>
But looking back now, everything what happened, I think I could still say "yeah, I wish it didn’t happen" because who would wish war to happen, but then it makes you always stronger and—oh, what it did to my perspective and experience as a human being.  To put it like that, I have a lot to pass to my children, how to fight out when things get tough, how to rise up and all that, so I would say to that child, [laughs] “don’t worry, you’ll be very strong person later.”
<br><br>
>>>Wow, that’s such a great message.  And do you have any goals or dreams now?
<br><br>
Just stability in life.  I don’t want to move anywhere else.  I don’t want to learn another language.
<br><br>
>>>As we know.  [laughs]
<br><br>
No, some stability.  Finally, I got a job, we are settling in Sweden.  Just you know what my only goal is stay healthy, that’s most important thing, good health.  That’s what I wish for.  Everything else, it sorts itself out, trust me.
