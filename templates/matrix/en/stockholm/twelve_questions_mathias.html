    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：26　Years in Stockholm: 24 <br>
     <br>  
Mathias I met at his (now previous) company’s summer party, that Lina invited me to. (The company was a digital design agency, and Mathias himself is a designer). So I actually met Mathias twice during my stay in Stockhom, and the second time I actually had him come along for one of my chores (and a drink) after his work. Talking with Mathias was interesting because it really gave me a glimpse of the thoughts and ideas held by the young crowd in Stockholm, and a bigger picture, Sweden. All the marvels of Swedish social security and governmental structure are really not geared towards the mid-twenty single population, and I was witnessing this as an outsider. Talking with Msathias about these subjects, and just general things regarding the future and goals, all led to an enlightening experience. For his answers, I recommend the future (Q.6), the thing (Q.7), children (Q.9), and the moments (Q.11). So Mathias, we’ll talk again (I MUST get this book contract going! haha), and if you’re in the mood, head over to Tokyo! Or maybe we can meet in LA…that would be interesting :)

    >>>I have to answer for the first time because I brought you here.  (Laughs) 
    <br><br> 
    Exactly.  But yeah then I could add to that, but, I like spontaneous decisions, if you will.  So I'm happy to tag along and see what happens.  See where we end up.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
I would probably go to L.A. [Los Angeles] to visit my brother. Because… I don't know.  There's a lot of places you can go, I guess, but it's nice to spend time with family if you get the chance. <br><br> >>>What's your brother doing in L.A.? <br><br> He's working there as an editor, a film editor.  For advertising, and he used to be a TV editor. <br><br> >>>Oh wow.  That's sweet. <br><br> Well, it's as good a place as any I guess.



 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Other than Sweden, I think I would say the U.S. as well.  I've been there a lot in my life, so I kind of know the culture, I know the places, I know…it feels a bit like home, like a place from my childhood. <br><br> >>>Where have you been in the U.S.? <br><br>  A lot of places, but mostly in Illinois. <br><br> >>>Illinois? <br><br> Yeah, and New York, I guess those are the two places I've been the most. <br><br> >>>You lived in New York. <br><br>I lived in New York, so New York. If New York was a country, that would be the place I feel close to I guess. <br><br> >>>By the way, your English sounds very American-English, which is kind of interesting. <br><br> Yeah, so since I grew up a bit in the U.S. I'm mostly influenced by American English and I guess the culture in Sweden allows… there's more culture coming in from the US than from the UK, so I think a lot of people have more of a—there are very few Swedish people that have a distinct British accent.  I always find that a bit weird when people have one unless they lived there. 

</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I think any place around the water and all of these kind of  “close to nature”, “close to water” places—like that island over there, for instance.  Having that so close to the actual city.  So I think that's very important for the whole feel of it. <br><br> >>>I see.  See that's sort of both of a place and a thing probably.  It's the water proximity. <br><br> Yeah that’s it.

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
I don't feel it needs to be redesigned, but I think there is a nice Swedish symbol of the three crowns and you can see that on the hockey team of Sweden. They have these three crowns and as well as the government or like the, what is that, the Parliament [flag].  They’re kind of a symbol for Sweden.  I'm not actually sure where they’re from but I always think it looks so nice so I would probably put them on the flag if I had to do something. <br><br> >>>Where would you put it on the flag because right now it's pretty symmetrical. <br><br> Yeah, that's a good question.  I'm not sure it would look great on flag [ Both laugh]. But as a symbol—well maybe just like a centric, ornament thing and just get rid of the cross. <br><br> >>>Oh I see.  Keep the colors? <br><br> Keep the colors.  Blue crowns on yellow, like the hockey jerseys.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
I think the ocean is the view from standing on the coast, not necessarily a beach but just standing on land and looking out and seeing the beginning of the ocean and “the endless” on the other side.  So I don't imagine being in a boat in the middle of it, more like standing on the shore. <br><br> >>>It doesn't have to be a beach…  That's pretty specific.  That's really cool.   <br><br> So maybe, I don't know, I keep thinking back to one of the places I grew up, which was right by the water, and they had this---what do you call it, not bridge, but where you go out and jump in the water... <br><br> >>>A pier? <br><br> Yeah, that thing, yeah.  And it was always obstructed by this island that was a couple of kilometers on the way, so apart from that you would have seen the ocean in that exact way but there was this strip of land just fucking it up. (Leo laughs) <br><br> >>>Well, welcome to Sweden right, the place where there's always a lot of islands. <br><br> There's always an island in the way.  You try to go to eternity and then there's an island. <br><br>  —The Sun<br> The sun.  I see the sun as the globe out in space, like a picture of the sun.  <br><br>  —Death<br> Silence I guess. <br><br> >>>Silence. <br><br> Yeah, or like absence. <br><br> >>>Absence. <br><br> Absence, silence, kind of a nothing, or nothingness, like when you're asleep.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
[For myself] I guess “forever undecided” is something that comes up, and something I strive for personally is to not have a kind of set out path or set out goal. I guess in general, mankind seems to be always be in that changing mode as well.  You never really know what's around the corner, so maybe that's what makes it interesting, I don't know. <br><br> >>>Well is it positive or negative or is it truly undecided? <br><br> Yeah, probably just undecided. You don't really know.   Yeah, maybe I'm cynical like that.  We'll see. What happens happens. <br><br> I don't worry too much about it because it's going to here soon enough and all you can do is your best to influence it, but it's going to get here.  But it's like mankind, it's a big thing but there's something interesting just happening with connectivity and global matters and it seems from what one point of view it's interesting how the world maybe speeds up a little bit more for each generation. Like if you think about communication, how slow that was fifty years ago, a hundred years ago, a hundred fifty years ago for trends, opinions, and in general, people’s awareness.  It depends on how you look on it.  Sometimes you can be amazed at how people are aware all over the globe, at the same time, about one thing. However, something shitty can happen, done by somebody or a group of people, and you just realize that there are many people who aren't on that same level of awareness. So I think it's always about a different pace.  I think that it's going to be a struggle for the ones that are in the “fast lane” to understand the people who aren't, if that makes any sense at all, I don't know.  It makes sense in here [Points at head]. <br><br> >>>I think we, and people reading sort of get what you're saying though.  It's true and the whole aspect of speed of information, speed of connectivity is a big deal, so... basically you're saying where the hell is all this technology gonna take us next. <br><br> Yeah.  (Laughs)  Exactly.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
 Um…that's a good question.  (Thinking)…Something that's important to me, I don't know if it's the most important thing, but just having access to friends and family.  I mean I could say of course “friends and family” but I think something that is very important is easy access to those people.  Like I said my brother is in L.A., my Mom is not in Stockholm and it's kind of amazing that you can just live your life in different places and still feel as close and have that connection… <br><br> >>>That's very unique.  That's very true too. <br><br> Yeah, because I mean friends and family sure, are most important, but... I sometimes imagined when I lived abroad if you wouldn't have that easy access to your people, how different your experience would be. <br><br> >>>Very true. <br><br> If you could sum it up in three letters that you send to your family rather than Skyping every week and if you had to come home and tell people about it rather than, “you know, you saw the Instagram feed. It was like well, whatever.”  It's like nobody asks you “how's it been, it's been ok?”  We never really get into any details like that.  But it’s cool that you could have those kind of parallel lives, so it makes it more accessible to go away.





</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
I think taking the initiative to be themselves is important...so the worst thing I notice when people don't have initiative to say what they want or act on what they want. So I would say somebody that's independent and knows what they want, basically.  No games.  Stuff like that.  (Both laugh)  Just like, no bullshit.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

Marriage:  Not, it's not necessary, like the ritual of marriage.<br> Children:  Yeah. <br><br> Not really.  I think it's probably easy to kind of project your own childhood onto your kids when in reality, they're just going to have… it's more important that they have their own childhood, if that makes sense.  So sure, it would be nice to show them around, like what you've done, but I don't think that's very interesting for them until they're grown up. So maybe just kind of listen to what they want and kind of getting closer to their dreams rather than fulfilling my own vision and like “I need to take you here because this is where I learned to ride my bike” and they don't care (Leo laughs). They're not going to care about that.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Well it would be nice to both wake up and fall asleep with the love of your life. That would be nice, of course. But yeah…that would be nice. <br><br> >>>That's pretty simple.  Should we just leave it that? <br><br> Pretty simple.  I don't know, maybe a great view.  Breakfast.  Breakfast is nice. <br><br> >>>You're giving all the key ones, I must say.  Those are the important ones. <br><br> (Laughs)  Exactly.  Yeah.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Alright.  (Thinking)… Trying to think if something stands out on the happy side. (Thinking again)… I mean I always liked  being in school after I moved to Stockholm. I was in school twice, and I always liked those moments because it's ...like when you're getting close to the end or close to the summer…it's very apparent that you're on your way to something together with your schoolmates, you know what I'm saying?  
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, its great! I think everybody can relate!
<br><br>
And you feel like you're part of something moving forward.  I don't know.  That's kind of a “happy maker” and I would say it was similar to when I was asked to play in this band with some friends that I met when I first moved to Stockholm.  I had no, absolutely no relation to them and just found them on a website.  They needed a guitar player and we became friends. I don't know, I think for me it's important to kind of achieve something, or make something of your time.  I would say any moment like that. <br><br> >>>So it's more of the sensation of getting there is what's the greatest moment. <br><br> Yes, exactly. <br><br> >>>That's so cool.  Do you have a terrifying moment? <br><br> Terrifying how? <br><br> >>>It could be anything. 
<br><br> Well there are like obvious ones.  I had a year and a half where I lost my dad and my uncle...kind of right after each other. So that's obviously a terrible one, but I don't really know how or where to get into that really. <br><br> >>>Yeah, I understand. <br><br> But I think, hmm…I think the first time I stayed in New York for a short while when I was like twenty or something.  I went for a month and it was probably the first time I really traveled alone. And I remember arriving at this apartment that I rented, and I didn't know, he never told me which apartment, only which floor and I vaguely remembered F5.  “Didn't they say that in an e-mail somewhere?”  And I opened the door and it was just pitch black; so it turns out his apartment started with a shallow kind of hallway. Pitch black.  So I just grabbed my bag and thought, “guess I have to go into this pitch black hallway.”  So I did that and there was a curtain and there was this real shoddy apartment, like really bad. <br><br> >>>Where was it, by the way, in New York? <br><br> In the East Village. <br><br> >>>Oh, the location is pretty nice. <br><br> Yes, but that, in my experience that means nothing actually.  Location can be deceiving. <br><br> >>>Obviously.  This black hallway sounds much worse than having a nice location. <br><br> Yes, so that's like on 13th street in the East Village and I think on that night when I was just exhausted from the trip and realized that “holy shit, what do I do now?  I guess I have to go to sleep here, like where am I, why did I do this,” whatever.  That was a pretty scary moment, I think, but it was good.  Came out from it. <br><br> >>>Why did you do that, by the way? Why did you do your month in New York, what was the goal? <br><br> I just to... see something else and just get out, I don't know. <br><br> >>>Did you get that accomplished? <br><br>  Oh yeah. <br><br> >>>So it was a successful month in New York? <br><br> Yeah, very. but that initial fear, it was kind of interesting afterwards [to look back on], but not during the actual experience...yeah.



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Right, I think my childhood dream was to… either be an inventor or the usual rock star business, you know?  Since I played music and I was “like sounds like a fun job”.  So yeah, my dad was an engineer and I was just fascinated by science or technology at whatever level you can be when you're six or eight years old. (laughs) So I wanted to invent stuff, which in the end kind of worked out because I have a creative job right now.  It's kind of a… it has similarity to that old dream, so yeah.  I'm happy with that. <br><br> >>>So what would you tell him? <br><br> What would I tell him?  About that dream in general, or just…?  Yeah, but would you want to spoil the fun to yourself when you're a kid by saying, “you're going to be this!” <br><br> >>>(Laughs) Good point! Or I guess you could just gaze upon him. <br><br> Yeah, just stare at him.  Stare at him I guess.  Just poke him in the chest, “Stay in school.” (Leo laughs) <br><br> >>>Alright, great.  And what is your goal or dream now if you have anything you can share with us. <br><br> Goal or dream now is…I actually don't know.  I'm having a period of time right now where I am just trying to figure something out.  I don't know.  I want to do something exciting.  I don't know what that is.  I don't know if it's because I've been traveling or just bored or what it can be, but, I don't know. Yeah, I want to be surprised.  That's my goal.
