    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：31　Years in Stockholm: Whole Life <br>
     <br>  
Nidal was introduced to me through Yamandu. Nidal is the owner and manager of Falafelbaren, which quite frankly, the best falafel I’ve ever eaten. And this comes from me as of now, December 2015, having eaten falafel all around the world. Unsurprisingly, I went to Falafelbaren a lot while I was in Stockholm. I had their wraps, the pita, on a plate, with all the amazing sauces, the galore…yeah, just an amazing eating experience. And reasonably priced too, considering its in Stockholm! Nidal himself is a super interesting dude, as you’d imagine with a guy who decided to start a falafel shop after going through various jobs and travels. You can tell he and his falafel are loved by friends and the community too, seeing the number of times he was interrupted during the interview haha. So yeah, all of his answers are great, and I’d recommend taking 15 minutes of your life to read them, but if you’re in a rush, I’d choose the thing (Q.7),  partner (Q.8), the moments (Q.11), and dreams (Q.12). So see you again Nidal, if you ever make it out to Asia, and holy do I want one of your falafels now! Gotta head to Stockholm!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    We’re in Falafelbaren which is a falafel bar. It’s a place my girlfriend and I started two years ago. It’s located in Hornsgatan in Sodermalm, Stockholm. And also this area…this part of Stockholm is where I grew up.
<br><br>
>>>Oh really? I didn’t know that.
<br><br>
So I’ve lived my whole life, not necessarily on this street, but on this island. It wasn’t this hip when I was growing up…totally different world.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
I would probably…usually I never go back to a place that I’ve already visited. I don’t know why, but I always end up going to new places. But if I were to go back, I would like to go to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. That’s a really nice city.
<br><br>
[A friend who has come to visit starts chatting with Nidal in Swedish]
<br><br>
So yeah, I like Kuala Lumpur a lot. It’s a nice city, with a lot of good food. If you had $2000, and wanted to live really well, Kuala Lumpur is the place. 
<br><br>
>>>When was the last time you were there? 
<br><br>
Four years ago I think. That was the last time. I’ve actually been there two times. One of the few cities. I really love Kuala Lumpur. 
<br><br>
>>>Why Malaysia though? I’m just curious. 
<br><br>
Well…we started off in Thailand. It was one of those backpacking trips, I did it when I was 20. And we went all over Thailand, and then to Malaysia. I really liked Malaysia. And then we went back a number of years later, when my girlfriend and I went to Australia for working holiday. We ended up working there for a few months, on an island outside of Cairns. So we left here to go to a giant island, only to end up on a tiny island, to work on a luxury hotel. Which was really cool but you get…well I went kind of crazy, being on an island, nothing there other than the hotel. We went to Bali after that, which is close, and then to Malaysia again. Mostly I like it for the food but its also really…a lot of places in Asia, the places themselves aren’t made for the locals. Like in Bali, you never see any Balinese people eating at the restaurants. Only westerners and Australians. 
<br><br>
[Another friend who has come to visit starts chatting with Nidal in Swedish]



 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
I feel close to a lot of places, it depends…I mean, Sweden is my home but…I actually felt home when I was in Italy. I was there for six months, in Florence when I was 19. I was studying Italian. 
<br><br>
>>>You look like you could be from Italy. 
<br><br>
Yeah, so when I was there, everybody thought I was Italian until I started speaking. And here, although it’s slowly changing, the stereotypical Swede is blond. So sooner or later, the topic of “Where are you from?” comes up. And I don’t know how it is in the US, but I think I could feel at home in US too until I start speaking, and then they’ll know because I don’t speak perfect English. So from just looking, the first eye, I could be from there. I can feel at home everywhere. Especially in New York, or any Mediterranean country. 
<br><br>
[Yet another friend who has come to visit starts chatting with Nidal in Swedish]
<br><br>
>>>You are loved by the community!
<br><br>
(Laughs) It’s just amazing…and yeah we might not be able to do the interview here because I’ll be interrupted! But no, so I feel at home in a lot of places, and I feel at home here as well. But…I don’t have that “special” place. I’m still looking for that place. Yeah. I’d like it to be warm. That’s my only criteria (laughs). 


</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/nidal/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
(Thinking)…Wow…(Thinks some more)…I have no idea. What do I think of when I think of Sweden…or Stockholm? …Maybe we’ll get back to that. 
<br><br>
>>>Nothing that comes to mind? 
<br><br>
Well there are all the normal things you can say, like cakes…(thinking)…the typical Swedish thing might be this “calm”. A calmness. Which…you can find it in Finland as well. It’s hard to describe it but it’s this calmness. It has to do with the whole atmosphere—the weather, how it’s a little cold even in the summer, say if you’re used to 35 degrees. We never get those summers. It’s always cool. The calmness. 
<br><br>
>>>That’s really cool. Do you have a place? 
<br><br>
Stockholm? Well, it depends. The first thing you see… when you come to Stockholm is probably T-Centralen [the central station] (Leo laughs). But I don’t think it’s a representative place for the rest of Stockholm. It’s a very chaotic place, T-Centralen, very unlike Stockholm. I never go there except when I’m going out of the city, to take the train or bus. But I never go there. It really stresses me out when I go there. But let me think of something else…
<br><br>
>>>No, that’s actually a great answer. Since it was the first thing that popped into your mind. 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
You know I’m like…well, Sweden is a little different from other states. It’s really old. The national state. Like Italy, is what? 200 years old? It’s not very old. The whole concept of Italy is new. But Sweden is a little older. Sweden…I guess it’s new too, but it doesn’t have this nationalistic concept of what Sweden is. Sweden was a part of Finland, or Finland was part of Sweden, and it was much bigger. Sweden lost a lot of land. There is a big Swedish-Finnish community that still lives in Finland. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah there are islands in between that speak both right? 
<br><br>
Yeah, and there is a big Finnish community in Sweden too. So I don’t think I would redesign flags. I think it’s good as it is. I don’t have any problems with the flag (laughs).  


 </p>

<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/nidal/3.jpg"></p>
<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
The first thing that comes up is my Dad’s cousin, who lives in Ako in Palestine. He has this amazing, AMAZING house in the old city in Ako. It’s actually integrated into the old wall, of the city. 
<br><br>
>>>What? 
<br><br>
Yeah, this city is really famous for being the only city that Napoleon couldn’t siege during his campaign in the Middle East.  He took Egypt, he took everything, but Ako, he didn’t manage to take. In the end he took his hat, and threw it over the wall, so he could get <i>something</i> into Ako. So my dad’s cousin lives there, and my family is from there, my grandmother’s side. And he has this amazing house, with a terrace, where you can see the wall going down. You see the city of Haifa on the other side. 
<br><br>
>>>This is incredible! 
<br><br>
So for me, it’s just something amazing, it’s what I think of when you say ocean. It’s the dream ocean view. 
<br><br>

—The Sun <br>
The sun, I think of Sweden in the summertime. I just think of these, weird, long, long days that never end. And how much you miss them, when they end, how they just slip out…and sooner or later it’s December, and you never see the sun anymore, the dark times. Then it March, April again, and suddenly you’re back to the sun never going down again. That’s what I imagine. The long days. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
(Thinking)…nothing really comes up when I think of death. I don’t think of death so much. 

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
For me, I see quite positive things for the future. It depends on whether you read the newspapers, but I stopped reading them (Leo laughs). I think the future holds something good. Not that everything is good now, but it will be fine. 
<br><br>
And for me, I’m just happy being able to do things that I want to do. Now it’s this, in five years it could be something else. It’s important for me to have some sort of financial stability in life—
<br><br>
 [Yet another friend who’s come to visit starts chatting with Nidal in Swedish]
<br><br>
—Sorry about that. So yeah, I think it’s going to be OK (laughs). Short and sweet. 
<br><br>
>>>You were talking about financial stability. 
<br><br>
But…you know, I don’t know if that’s really true, because we had zero financial stability when we started this. We had some sort of capital to start, but we had only that. And then it turned out well, so it’s fun. But if I were to do it again, something similar, I would maybe try to have some sort of financial stability. So you don’t have to put all in every time. 
<br><br>
When I was backpacking when I was young, I would have this much [a certain amount of] money to spend for three or four months. And I would spend it until when I came back I had zero or even minus crowns on my bank account. Then you have to start working again to build up. So, I think as I get older, for me, the more tiring it gets. So from now on, I’ll try to play it a little safe, but I hope I can keep creating and fulfilling projects, which I like to do. 




</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/nidal/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
(Thinking)…It’s…to feel good. 
<br><br>
>>>Nice. 
<br><br>
Yeah, in a way. It’s very important. Because I remember, when we started this [Falafelbaren], we started it as a cafeteria, really serving only coffee. And it was going…really only so-so. We had to do something drastic—“OK, what are we going to do? Either sell [the shop] or…” because we couldn’t continue. And we decided to do falafel. Falafel had been something I wanted to do, on my mind for about eight years. Starting a place. But it was somewhere hidden [in my mind]. So we just put it on the menu. We didn’t name it anything, like Falafelbaren or anything, we just put it on the menu. First day on the menu, a guy came in and ordered it. Actually, he came in and asked if we had a sandwich, so I said “No we don’t. But we have felafel.” And he came back and said “This was fantastic!“ But that was the only felafel we sold that day. So we made 60 crowns, and you don’t have to be Einstein to understand that that isn’t enough, that we’re not breaking even. 
<br><br>
But I—me and Jenny—we went home, and I was HAPPY. Because…I don’t know why. But from that day, it turned. I went to work, and I was happy. The next day we sold five felafel, then 10 felafel. But I worked with a nice, positive energy. And I know that the world isn’t like that, that feeling good isn’t enough. You have to earn money, you have to eat, you have to have all these things. But it’s also important to feel good about different things you do. Then the rest will come. I think. I hope it’s like that. 
<br><br>
Sometimes you have to prioritize. And especially when you live in a country…we’re part of the 1% that can afford to fly. And we’re not even rich compared to the other guys who have millions and millions and millions of money. But we have enough money to fly, being from Sweden. We have all these opportunities. And when you live in a country that gives you all these opportunities, you have to not be afraid, and at least try to fulfill them. 




</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Jenny…well I think I look for Jenny (laughs). I actually don’t look for any special thing. You need to you know…well, connect. Not hate each other (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>How long have you been with each other? 
<br><br>
5, 6 years now I think, yeah it’s been a long time. What she does is, she supports me a lot, with all of my crazy ideas, because I think of these crazy ideas. She stands by me, and supports me, the whole way through. And I hope I’m doing the same for her too. But I think that is an important thing. 
<br><br>
People sometimes ask, I love it actually when they do, “How do you manage it as a couple?” because we live together and work together (Leo laughs). But there is no problem. Yeah we work together, but when we go home, there’s always something to talk about. And it’s not about us. Because I know her now. I couldn’t stand it, say if we were in a dinner, and we had to talk [about ourselves] because how much can you talk? There’s a limit to how much you can know about a person. So when we talk, we talk about projects, like this one, or other projects. Or where to travel―we have the same interests, she likes to travel, I like to travel, she likes food, I like food. We have this project, this restaurant together, and problems occur all the time. One guy calls in sick, one girl never shows up, she’s doing a great job, he’s doing an amazing job―there’s always something to talk about. It’s kind of relieving because it’s not about us, and we don’t have to talk about us all the time. There’s so many other things to put our energy into together.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

Marriage: Marriage to me is something…it’s like a business commitment. It’s not something that’s romantic. We were supposed to get married, but we had to file some sort of paper to ask to “get married,” so they can call you and check up on you to see if you’re not siblings (Leo laughs), and give you this paper that you have three months to turn in. And we had this paper and forgot to…yeah so we were supposed to get married (laughs). But yeah, I don’t have this image of a romantic wedding. 
<br><br>
Children: No. 
<br><br>
>>>Can you explain why? 
<br><br>
Well, this is now, I don’t know if I’ll be answering the same thing in 10 years but for now…I don’t have…I don’t feel I need children at all. I feel that there are a lot of children, especially at my age of 31, everyone is getting children around me. Like, <i>everyone</i>. And I like children, but I feel there are more than enough children around me. 
<br><br>
My little brother has a child who is like 4 years old, and I feel like that’s enough around me. It’s nice to be the fun uncle who can give them ice cream even though it’s a regular weekday (Leo laughs), so I don’t feel like I need to have one. It also kind of freaks me out. So many things that can go wrong. There’s no guarantee that things won’t go wrong. That you’ll get a nice child. 
<br><br>
>>>You can try your best. 
<br><br>
Yeah (laughs) I know, but there are so many things that can happen, and I’m not comfortable with all the risks. (laughs)


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
(Thinking)…(lowers voice) I’m going to be romantic (normal voice), no it will be my girlfriend. I’m going to be stereotypical (laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>If it’s true, that’s all that matters! For both?
<br><br>
Yeah I think so. Although for going to sleep it might be the television, which is more close to the truth (laughs). No, no I’m just kidding! 


 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/nidal/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Oooh!! I know the most terrifying. I didn’t know what it was at the time, but it’s when I had sleeping paralysis. So I went to sleep and I thought I was hearing sounds, and that sort of freaked out my mind. And then I woke up in the middle of the night, without being able to move, and hearing this strange sound. It was like “Kkkkkrrrhhhhhh” in my ears. And something pushing against my chest. Something which I thought was trying to kill me. I’ve never felt evil before, but that was pure evil; it was trying to kill you. I couldn’t move, and I was trying to get out of that paralysis. I didn’t dare open my eyes until I just had to, and then I did. The sound wouldn’t stop, it would just continue, continue. 
<br><br>
After the incident, I thought it was that I had seen a ghost. That I was  attacked by an evil spirit in my own house. But after I talked with my dad, and my dad’s wife―I was telling everybody about this because I hadn’t believed in ghosts, and my whole world had been turned upside-down in those two weeks. I actually moved in with Jenny, into her house, because I didn’t dare to sleep at my own place alone. So it was very dramatic for me. 
<br><br>
So my father’s wife told me “maybe it’s this“ which was sleep paralysis. And I started reading about it, and yes, it WAS sleep paralysis.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, the incidents all have similar stories huh.
<br><br>
Yeah but I didn’t know. And some people see the devil, other people see other things, but I didn’t see anything. I just felt this presence over me. And yeah, I had never been afraid my whole life. I called my brother―after a while I could start moving―so I ran out and called my brother, at two or three in the morning, and the only thing I could say was “There…there’s a ghost in my apartment!!!” (Leo laughs) And guess what? He believed me!!  
 <br><br>
>>>Wow! Really? 
<br><br>
Yeah! And he came running, and arrived in like five minutes! 
<br><br>
>>>What a great brother!!
<br><br>
He was like “What happened!?” Because yeah, for me, it was real! He heard my voice, and thought it was real too. So that was the most terrifying. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow! And your happiest??
<br><br>
Oh my happiest!! I know it, I have it. I can compare it, I think, to the feeling of having your first child. It’s when I got my license, my driver’s license (laughs). Because for me, I went to hell and back to get it. It took me 10 years. I started when I was 18, and sort of gave up. I put in so much honour and prestige into getting this license. 
<br><br>
I had always been good in school, but I failed the theory portion of it. Because the test has both theory and practice. And I failed the theory part three times.
<br><br>
>>>What??
<br><br>
Yeah. And the fourth time I took it, it was just two years ago. I was so nervous. I was thinking of moving, leaving Sweden, I couldn’t see anyone in the eyes…I was putting so much personal prestige into it, which was really stupid. So I took the theory, and the practice also, and went to hell. I had been practicing for a year, and as soon as it became a test, I couldn’t―I couldn’t drive!
<br><br>
I wanted to do it differently from all the other people in the world. I didn’t take any lessons, Jenny taught me how to drive. And the third time―it was sort of this last chance because you only have 2 months to finish the whole process or it gets reset. And so I talked to my uncle. 
<br><br>
>>>Is this your uncle in Palestine? 
<br><br>
Yeah, because he also lives here too. And something he said…you know, most of the time I think that it’s intellectually stupid to “think positively.” For me personally. However something he said, something like “Why are you making such a big deal about this?”
<br><br>
>>>Getting a driver’s license! 
<br><br>
Yeah. And I had already assumed I would fail, just so I wouldn’t get disappointed when I did. But along the way, I changed my mindset. I became like a sports coach: “You can do it!! You can do it!!”
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Like a Nike commercial or something! 
<br><br>
“Come on! You’re good!” All this positive stuff and it felt ridiculous! But as I sat there, I felt good. And after I finished, the lady said, “Congratulations! You have your license!” and I just started crying in the car. (Leo laughs). I was―I just had to give her a hug, and I hugged her. And she said “Look, honestly I didn’t think you were going to get it today. This was your last chance.”
<br><br>
>>>Yeah and she knows your history too, huh. 
<br><br>
Yeah, she was like “You can’t get the right gear with your shift, you don’t have any control of the situation―basically it says you can’t drive. You can’t drive. And today, you drove!” All this, because it was all in my head. And it just felt like I won. I won the grand slam of tennis. It felt the best I’ve felt in my life. (Both Laugh)



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to become a tennis pro. But it didn’t work out (Leo laughs). It was the same thing as the license―I kept losing all the games. I didn’t have the “match” instinct. After that I wanted to work in politics. I wanted to become an international rights lawyer, or something like that. Those were my childhood professional dreams. After that I sort of lost my way. I went into political science, but my life didn’t take off into that direction, for some reason. 
<br><br>
If I had to tell something to the childhood me, I would tell him to study law (Both laugh). If you want to have an easy life, do that, study law. Just take your time and…actually I didn’t get the grades to go into law, they were a little too low. But I could have read and studied on my own, and tried again to get accepted. But I took the easy way and went into political science. Everybody gets accepted into political science. Of course though, that makes the competition 10 times harder. And I didn’t put the effort in. So that’s what I would tell him, if that’s still his goal. 
<br><br>
For me my life became…well, in 2004, my father started a factory that produced hummus for retail chains throughout Sweden. And it became my job because I was helping my dad out. I learned a lot about running your own business, and it was a good school. I learned a lot, I gave it four years of my life. I didn’t know anything in the beginning, but my job was to sell the products to the chain supermarkets. And from there, we sort of ended up here. There was no clear…I actually wish I wanted to be a doctor, or that my vision was that much clearer, because then I would have saved so much time. But for me, it’s not like that. It’s still blurry. 
<br><br>
>>>So what is your dream now? 
<br><br>
It’s still blurry, but I don’t feel as bad about that as I did before. Because before, I had this anxiety that I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life.  Now I still don’t know, but I don’t feel bad about it, which is really nice. Because I wanted a profession, I wanted to <i>be something</i>. I wanted a title. Captain! (Leo laughs) Or lawyer, or whatever, because I thought that was really important for me. Now I don’t feel like I need it, and I don’t feel bad about it.
