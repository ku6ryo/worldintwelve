    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：--　Years in Stockholm: 20 <br>
     <br>  
Sauman was introduced to me through Enni. My first encounter with Sauman was at a mid-summer dinner in Uppsala at Enni’s flat, where I also got to meet her wonderful husband and beautiful baby. The next time I met Sauman was at her home studio, where I got a full on glam/make up job for a practice shoot. The entire occasion was an interesting experience, especially conducting the interview and getting my hair and face done at the same time! Talking with Sauman was also a learning experience, and everything that she has gone through—from living in Singapore and Dubai, starting and leaving a company that she considered here child—was shocking, exhilarating, and thought provoking. Life, as I’ve witnessed throughout the year talking with so many people, is truly a rollercoaster (and one where you don’t know where you end up!) Sauman gave simple but strong answers (while blowdrying my hair), and if I were to choose some, they would be the important thing (Q.7), marriage/children (Q.9), the moments (Q.11), and the dreams (Q.12). So Sauman, hope to see you soon, and maybe your family can come to Japan!! That would be cool :)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
This place is actually my home and it’s my what should I say? My home office. And today shooting here because I have the best light and I have the best wall.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a good reason.
<br><br>
That’s a fantastic reason.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
Oh, definitely I would go to South Africa because in South Africa, you can do safari. And I love to see the animal in the nature. That would be a cool experience.
<br><br>
>>>Have you done it before?
<br><br>
Never.
<br><br>
>>>Oh. Then it is a cool experience.
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, I’d love to see animals in the nature, too.
<br><br>
Yeah and I would love to stay in a jungle hotel. So… it’s inside a safari.
<br><br>
>>>One month might be kind of long for that?
<br><br>
Yeah, I’d travel around maybe in Africa.




 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
I can only choose one?
<br><br>
>>>Yes. But…you can sort of say more than one. It’s not against the rules but… (laughs)
<br><br>
Okay. I do feel safe in Singapore. But I can feel the lives and the happiness and the fashion in London. And I wish….(thinking)… We had this shopping and food court in Dubai, so if I could put together a dream country, it would be all those three. And of course Sweden with the water. I love the Swedish water, and Swedish air because it’s clean. 
<br><br>
>>>So basically you feel close to all of the places?
<br><br>
Yes.


</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/sauman/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Oh… (Thinking)… That’s tough. It definitely gets me thinking. I definitely think…(thinking) We should go to the city here, because that’s the mix of people. Mix of like, in Stockholm, there’s not so different kinds of people inside Stockholm based in…like Ostermalm there are rich people. There’s Soder which is in South. Not poor but not their aesthetic and they don’t have this high key standard. There’s minimum type of people but I think in the city is still that area where everything comes together. So yeah.

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
I wouldn’t do anything because I love it. I love the two colors because they’re so vibrant and they have a contrast from each other. I think it’s lovely color. I would say blue and yellow. Sorry, bit boring answer. (laughs) Of course I’m just one person.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Sauman: Blue.
<br><br>
>>>Is that it?
<br><br>
That’s it. 

<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Sauman: Well, happiness. That’s it.
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Sauman: All calmness right now. That’s it.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Okay. I think the future is bright, actually. I think that my business is doing well. I think Sweden is going slowly up to being a stable country. And I know we have lots of money problem in Sweden, and the whole world, but I still think that, you know, we’re going through it and we’re coming out from it. We are in the beginning of the end, if you understand what I mean.
<br><br>
>>>Hm. And that’s a positive image though? The beginning, right?
<br><br>
Yeah. We have to be positive! 




</p>
   <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/sauman/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
My baby and God.
<br><br>
>>>That’s pretty simple! (Laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. And then food.
<br><br>
>>>Could you explain about food? I think the other two everybody can understand. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Food. Shall I explain about food?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah.
<br><br>
Food makes, it’s a passion. Food makes you happy. Food makes you feel things. Food can make you, you know, you have to have food to survive. So food is everything. And I think food can give the five senses. Eyes, you can see it. You can smell it, you can taste it. You touch it. You can even hear it. So I felt I think food is the most important. 




</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Oh…Okay. Stableness. You have to be stable.
<br><br>
>>>Stableness?
<br><br>
Yeah. You have to be stable and calm. Because I’m a drama queen. I’m definitely not stable. I’m definitely not calm. I’m super not calm. So I need someone to push me down into Earth. And he is a typical north person from Sweden who is good at pushing me down to the Earth.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, we were talking about this. You said he was like a mountain.
<br><br>
Yeah, he is a mountain.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/sauman/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>

Yeah. (Thinking)… I’m doing a photo shoot with him. He is my model and I’d like to travel more with him, actually. I think we’re traveling too little. We already started travel a lot. So I’m thinking… Is it ok? [Sauman plucks Leo’s eyebrows]
<br><br>
>>>No, that’s good. My girlfriend always tells me I should do that, so I can tell her you did it for me. (Both laugh) So traveling. Is there an image that you have him of growing up? This might relate sort of to what I was asking before because growing up, he’ll be a boy in Sweden. And I guess that has something to do with it or just in general?
<br><br>
 I want him to be a traditional Chinese boy in Sweden even when he’s second or third generation, of Swede here in Sweden. So I would like to do the traditional speaking Swede or Chinese. Chinese-Swede. It’s very important. I want him to start to do like maybe old Shaolin Kung Fu.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, cool.
<br><br>
Yeah because it’s important to know the tradition. 
<br><br>
>>>Another thing that you’re talking about is the saying your thank-you’s.
<br><br>
Yes. You have to be polite and always be super, almost super polite. Not just polite. You have to be super polite because unfortunately, people in Sweden, they are not that super polite. But Asian people are. Or maybe people in Japan is so, so polite and I’d like to, rather go to that part. And be so polite than not polite. I do believe you become further in life if you are that polite. Yeah.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Yeah, of course, my baby and my husband.
<br><br>
>>>Yes.
<br><br>
That’s it. Sorry.
<br><br>
>>>Don’t have to apologize! For both answers? 
Yes.



 </p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/sauman/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
The most terrifying would have to be when I left my company to move the firm and staff, to know that [there are] 300 people we don’t need anymore. And to know that I’m closing down all the studios. Seven studios to close down and 300 staff we don’t need. You’re getting shit scared because you don’t know how the day after will be, and that was the most scary feeling you know. Money-wise, or that you lost your family. It is your family and your baby because you created this company. That was the most scary feeling. 
<br><br>
The best feeling would have to be when, it’s cliché to say, but it’s when my son came out. But that was not that fun. (Leo laughs) Because it was painful… but I have to say. It would have to be when I got to the first shift for my new company. Have to say that because that shows that I’m back again. So I’m doing the same thing again. I’m doing it smaller scale and I’m doing it with a baby. I’m working half time.
<br><br>





 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to be someone who could help people because I always like to help people. And my dream was to open up a photo studio.
<br><br>
>>>Cool!
<br><br>
And give people the knowledge about how beautiful they are and I did it!
<br><br>
>>>You did it!
<br><br>
I did it! 
<br><br>
So that’s what you would tell your childhood you, obviously?
<br><br>
>>>You mean what I should tell my child he’s supposed to?
<br><br>
Not your child. The childhood, so if you could go back in time and you saw little Sauman, what would you say to her?
<br><br>
Life is hard.
<br><br>
>>>Even though you did it.
<br><br>
Yeah. Life is hard. My dad always said like this, and I would say it to myself. Life is hard. You get pushed down but you just have to stand again, you know? It’s all about doing that step of laying down, and standing up. If you lay down and stand again and start to walk again, then you’re a survivor. That’s all you have to do.
<br><br>
>>>Wow. 
<br><br>
Deep.
<br><br>
>>>What is your dream or goal now? Final part.
<br><br>
To get more customers. And get my big contracts. Oh, my contracts which I would like to have or love to have. Is H&M and Kappa. Kappa, that big clothing brand. I am almost there, but it’s still very tough. So when I get that, then I feel like, you know, I’m done with photo and I finish photo after seven years. But I just need to reach those two companies.
