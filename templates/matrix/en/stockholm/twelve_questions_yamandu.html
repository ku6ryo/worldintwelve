    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：39　Years in Stockholm: 39<br>
     <br>  
    Yamandu was my partial roommate at Lena’s place in Stockholm. He was actually the first person to greet me at the door when I arrived! Having been in the food business for most of his life, when Yamandu made me a home cooked Mediterranean stew as a welcoming meal (and finished it off with his favourite Ben and Jerry’s!!), not only was it delicious, it had a special warmth that you just can't forget. Yamandu is the definition of super-fun, always cracking jokes and giving insightful opinions (like the cuteness of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFdUGs6qIuw">Jero the enka singer</a> after I showed him a clip haha), and he literally made my stay in Stockholm a 1000% more amazing. Oh, and last but not least, he is a demigod in the Stockholm Grindr scene :) !!! For his answers, I like his month (Q.1), his images (Q.5), his partner (Q.8), and his dream (Q.12). So Yamandu, it was sad leaving the comfort of you and Lena, but come to Tokyo and we can go to Nichome!! Haha 



</p>
       <br>
    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place:  This is Lena’s Place. That's one of my best friend's apartment. We're staying here, both you and I, because I'm renting out my apartment. And so I'm staying here while I rent it out. And you're here because you're renting out one of her rooms. And we're having a great time, so far. 
<br><br>
>>>And they'll be more fun times to come! Alright. 

  </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/yamandu/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  For 20,000 Krona?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah, You have 20,000 Krona to go wherever you like and do whatever you like. It's basically a vacation month. 
<br><br>
With 20,000, that's not a lot.
<br><br>
>>>I know. I sort of gave you my budget. 
<br><br>
Well… what I would do… is go to New York and just shop the shit out of myself. (Leo laughs). And then I would like, I don't know, stay at some friend's place. 
<br><br>
>>>So there goes the rent. You don't have to pay anything. 
<br><br>
I don't have to pay anything. Eat cheap good food and buy like really expensive clothes. Not like really expensive clothes, but like, clothes that we don't have here in Stockholm. I would do a lot of second hand shopping as well, because I know there's like… much more than we have here in Stockholm. I've been doing that, I've done that before. Like 5 years ago, I was in New York, i bought a lot of second hand. And, I kind of feel I need to do that soon again. So if you have 20,000, just, (clicks mouth) I'll do it!  (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>So, it'd be New  York then? Interesting. 
<br><br>
Yeah. New York, yeah. I kind of miss New York. I haven't been there for five years. So I want to go back there. 


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  Uruguay. 
<br><br>
>>>Because... your father?
<br><br>
Because my father is from Uruguay and I've been there a lot. And I have a lot of memories from there from when I was a child. And I haven't been there since ’98. So ti's been almost 20 years ago. So I feel like I… it's like a nostalgic thing there. 
<br><br>
>>>But you wouldn't spend your month there? You'd go to New York?
<br><br>
No. I would definitely like to spend a month there. I have a house there. So we have like,  it's different. like  just give me 20,000 to do whatever I want. I could go to Uruguay whenever. Like New York is like a want thing. 
<br><br>
>>>A vacation type thing. 
<br><br>
Spend my money on something hysterical, it would be New York. 

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/yamandu/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
  The water, I would say. 
<br><br>
>>>The water… Interesting. So that would be both the place and the thing you'd think?
<br><br>
The things around the water and the water itself. And the things, the fact that you can actually buy a boat, go to different places. It's like what I told you about today. That would represent to me Stockholm. 

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
  Well, I never thought about that. (Leo laughs) It never crossed my mind. I'm not so much into flags at all, actually. But… we have a little… it's like an issue in Sweden about the Swedish flag. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. I was talking with Lena about it. 
<br><br>
Yeah. It comes a little bit of a nationalistic symbol, the Swedish flag. So people tend to not be proud of the flag. We don't have the same problems in Sweden as they do in other European countries. Like the French are like, they are really french and they love their flag. And the history of their flag. Yada yada. Me personally I couldn't care less. I'm not that… I'm not into that at all. So I would have to say that I would just instead of rearrange the flag, I would just leave it as it is. And let people have their own associations with the current flag.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
(Thinking) Okay. Waves. 
<br><br>
>>>Waves. 
<br><br>
Like huge waves, like a storm. 
<br><br>
>>>Like a storm?
<br><br>
That's the ocean. 
<br><br>
>>>Like a stormy wave?
<br><br>
Yeah. It's like a Swedish writer, August Strindberg, that is dead now. He made a painting and that painting's called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=August+Strindberg+painting&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CCAQsARqFQoTCKadn4Pm1scCFUpyFAodzT8ImA&biw=1423&bih=778#tbm=isch&q=August+Strindberg+painting+the+storm">“The Storm”</a>.  And that's what I had pop up. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow. That's very cool.  I've gotten waves a lot. But I've never gotten storm.
<br><br>

—The Sun<br>
The sun? (Thinking)…Huge. 
<br><br>
>>>Huge. (laughs)
<br><br>
Like for me, the sun is like… the center. Everything is centered around the sun. It just makes me realize how small this world is and… the planet is and we are really just a tiny, tiny dot in a bigger something. Like infinity is… so big. And this planet is like so small. So that's “big”. Huge. 
<br><br>

—Death<br>
Death. I never think of death actually. 
<br><br>
>>>That's a good answer. 
<br><br>
It’s… I'm just… I never think of death. Unless it's like, I read the paper and someone died. I don't know if it's like… I'd rather think of life than death. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Imagery…Unfortunately I have to be a little negative there. I think the future, I mean, environmentally, we're just going to kill ourselves by doing so much damage to this planet. I think it's unstoppable. We could hit the brakes, but it won't stop. Anyways. We're going one direction and that direction is, “smack”. That's the future. 
<br><br>
>>>That's probably most negative one I’ve gotten (laughs). 
<br><br>
Yeah. Yeah. I'm just being realistic. 
<br><br>
>>>That's your opinion so you can say whatever you want. 
<br><br>
Considering how it was 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 1000 years ago. I think we're doing so much damage, and unfortunately, it will one day hit us like that.  So, hopefully it won't be like that but I'm pessimistic, actually realistic. But you know. That's the future of this world.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Love. 
<br><br>
>>>…Would you like to elaborate or just leave it at love?
<br><br>
No… just love. Like, me, I have a lot of siblings, I have a mom, I have a dad. And every once in awhile, I have to remind myself of showing…showing them that I love them. And tell them that I love them. It's important. And, I really suck at it because sometimes it can go weeks without telling them that they really do mean everything to me. And I would be less without them. So… that's the one. 



</p>


    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
My partner…(thinking)… a lot of things. I can't really narrow it down to one word. 
<br><br>
>>>You don't have to do one word here. You can talk until tomorrow morning if you want to. I'll have to edit a bit, but...
<br><br>
It's a hard one…. Can I come back to that question?
<br><br>
>>>Oh. Yes. Very cool. I've never had that before. 
<br><br>
Alright. 
<br><br>
[<i>After the last question</i>]
<br><br>
Oh yeah. What was that question?
<br><br>
>>>What do you look for in a partner?
<br><br>
That one. (Thinking)…Obviously a lot of things like mutual respect, consideration, empathy, all those cliche things. (Leo laughs) Also it has to be a fiscal example of perfection. Almost. Not perfection, but almost perfection. 
<br><br>
>>>Ohhh. That's pretty, for all the people aspiring to land this man. 
<br><br>
(laughs)  You know we've talked about this before. Respect is my thing. It doesn't have to be perfection in other people's eyes. Basically what I look for is respect. It's number one. Respect me and I will respect you. And we will respect each other. Above all, respect others, not only me. And have consideration for other people. That is so sexy. People helping other people. It doesn't have to be me your helping, but helping a old lady cross the street. I eat you up because that is so sexy. 
<br><br>
That's part of the perfection. Alright. We are done!

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/yamandu/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
 Marriage: No. <br>
Children: Hmmm….yes and no. That's a hard one. 
<br><br>
>>>What's the yes aspect of it? 
<br><br>
The yes aspect is that I love kids. They're so cute. And no is I think… well right now since I don't have kids, I feel like I enjoy being alone in that way. That I don't have my own family. Of course I have a family because I have my mom, dad. But it's a sense of freedom to not have children. Kind of an egoism. I can do whatever I want, I can read whatever, I can travel whenever I want. I can buy whatever I want with the money I have. I don't have to consider a family to feed or children to educate. Even though I have no doubt that I would be a good father. Of course, I know that. 
<br><br>
>>>You'd be a great father!!
<br><br>
I'd be a great father. I have my sister's and brother's children. They mean like a lot to me. and I love them. And I try to do the best that I can for them, within certain limits of course. But… I don't have… because I'm gay, it's not like I can… it's a little bit harder to be a dad when you're gay. But the possibility is out there of course. I don't know. I guess I have to find a partner. When I have a partner. Then I, you know. 




</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 My plants and my home flowering. I would love to smell, have the scent of those plants, those flowers. And when I do, I'm happy all day. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow. Awesome. What about before you fall asleep?
<br><br>
Before I fall asleep…(thinking)…I don't know, some cool tune or something music wise. Something mellow, great song. 
<br><br>
>>>You play music right now. Do you do that right now?
<br><br>
Yeah, with my headphones. Not in this apartment because...
<br><br>
>>>There's people. (laughs)
<br><br>
Yeah. There's other people around. But when I'm at my place, I always listen to music when I sleep. In the background, like soft music.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/stockholm/twelve_questions/yamandu/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
I have a lot happy memories. Not so terrible memories. Happy memories, one that just pops up like that is when my parents and my family and my granddad in Italy. And we were in Venice. And we were going by boat, the gully boats. And I have a memory when it was very sunny. And my grandpa was joking with me. That's a happy memory, a child memory. 
<br><br>
>>>That's a great child memory. 
<br><br>
And I don't know, a terrible memory. I have a terrible memory, but it's kind of personal. So I can’t.
<br><br>
>>>If you don't want to share it, it's OK. 
<br><br>
Okay. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything you can share or should we just leave it at that?
<br><br>
Well I only have one terrible memory and that's the one and I can't share it. 
<br><br>
>>>Alright. Sounds great. 
<br><br>
Sorry. 
<br><br>
>>>No, no no. That's actually a great answer. Everybody will just read this and wonder.



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>s
Well I didn't have a childhood dream, oh when I grow up I want to be an astronaut or a doctor or whatever. 
<br><br>
>>>You didn't?
<br><br>
I didn't. Not that I can remember. Maybe I had like one for a month or a week or, I don't know.  (Leo laughs)  I don't know. I'm like living for today. I guess I did that when I was younger too. I didn’t… I don't know if it's because my parents never, “oh you have to do this”, they were very like, realistic in a way. They always pushed me to do whatever I wanted to do. And they helped me within their frame of whatever they could help with. Of course they were always there for me and still are. They helped me very much and still do. And all the children, my siblings. I mean, if I wanted to, for instance, study to be a doctor, they would have made sure that I did. It was never in my mind. I'm too much of a free bird. I do whatever I feel like doing now. And tomorrow if I want to do something else, I'll drop everything I'm doing and do that instead. That's kind of me in a nutshell. I can't plan for tomorrow because I can't tomorrow. I'm not going to stay 5 years reading a book to become something. 
<br><br>
>>> (laughs) Just not realistic. 
<br><br>
No. That's just not me. 
<br><br>
>>>So what would you tell the childhood you?
<br><br>
I would tell him “Good job baby”. That's what I would say. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs). Okay. And do you have any dreams or goals now?
<br><br>
Well, not big dreams. Like a goal, I have like a tiny little, it's not so important. I want to have a small house or something I can grow things. 
<br><br>
>>>By grow things, you mean plants, right?
<br><br>
Plants. Plants, trees, edible, non edible—green stuff. I'm a lot into it. 
<br><br>
>>>Which is great because you're surrounded by green stuff in this video. It looks cool. 
<br><br>
Yeah. True. 
<br><br>
>>>One of the houses that will probably be in the photo shoots would be a good one, huh? 
<br><br>
Yeah. I would love to have one of those. 
<br><br>
>>>Not to mention, you could grow things inside of it. But also outside. 
<br><br>
Exactly. 
<br><br>
>>>Perfect. Alright. We usually end there. But we have one last question, we have to go back!! (To Q.7)
