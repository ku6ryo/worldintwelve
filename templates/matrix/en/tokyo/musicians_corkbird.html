    <p>We are Corkbird, a three-piece band based in Tokyo. We try to make music focusing on the trifling changes of heart that we feel in our everyday lives. To the surrounding people its completely trivial, but to the individual its something dramataic. Thats the type of background music we aim to create! (Song Title translation: Tokyo 23o'clock)

   <br>【Members】Ryo Kuroki(Gt,Vo)、Haruna Kanematsu(Ba,Cho)、Taiki Kneko(Dr)</p>

    <p>Leo's Take: I've known Ryo, the leader, since my first day of university, when we were both considering joining a band circle. In the end, neither of us joined but we've been friends ever since. Corkbird is a band which truly reflects the moist, translucent, nostalgic side of Tokyo, and all their songs reflect this feeling and the true spirit of a three-piece band. Ok, I think I'm going to go stare at the sunset now.</p>
