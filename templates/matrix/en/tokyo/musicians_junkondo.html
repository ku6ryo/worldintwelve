    <p>Leo's Take: Jun is an amazing musician an even better friend. I first met him when he came to record at my studio with his band, We Want Wine. The music they made was so exactly like what I like to listen to, it was pretty amazing. He also has helped me out so much with my own personal musical projects, I really can't thank him enough. We will definitely do some stuff when I get back to Tokyo. </p><br>
    <p>PS: Check out some of his previous work in We Want Wine <a target="_blank"
