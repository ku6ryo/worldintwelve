    <p>Leo's Take: Ryotaro and I go back to when I was running my recording studio during my university days. He was in a band then, and he's doing a cool musical project now. I guess we are all changing. This song combines shoegaziness with a beat; its something special where you're body is rocking now and you'll be humming the tune later. This is just the beginning, and I can't wait for more!! </p>
