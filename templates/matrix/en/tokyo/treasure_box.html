    <br>
    <p>Round 1: Everybody is a little nervous, as this was the first round of the test city. Everything was new. The three members put their treasure on the table. Jay couldn't make it because of a cold, so he sent pics via email.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Susan: PASMO (Metro Card)</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Coming from Australia, it was only recently that an efficient travel and money system using cards was installed. </li>
          <li>The hectic, fast-paced life style of Tokyo is highlighted through its transportation system. </li>
          <li>It's something I always have in my wallet. Everyone has one, its an essential part of daily life. Like brushing your teeth. </li>
          <li>The scanner where you touch the card has been researched and placed at an angle which is most efficient. Its not flat. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Jay: Map</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Every treasure hunter needs to own a map. Gladly technology becomes handy these days.</li>
          <li>Offline city map+GPS positioning has been a great help in my aimless and never ending walks. </li>
          <li>In the same time allows me to pin new discoveries: vintage record stores, yummy eateries or intriguing locations to revisit and photograph.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Aimi: Fake Eylashes</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Originally derives from the GAL culture in Shibuya, but now is a common item for all girls. </li>
          <li>You don't see people in other countries wearing them.</li>
          <li>The eyelashes make your eyes look bigger, an obvious indication of the complex held by Japanese girls towards their eyes. </li>
          <li>Each one is intricately and delicately designed, in a very Japanese way.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Leo: LED Lightbulb</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Tokyo is a city that never sleeps, and that can be seen through all the lights that are on 24/7.</li>
          <li>However, there are efficiency and ecological problems with the normal lightbulb. </li>
          <li>The LED lightbulb was invented in Japan, and all the lights in the city are slowly being switched to these. </li>
        </ul>

    <br>
    <p>Round 2: After a successful round one, the participants are a little more relaxed. Conversations take place more freely. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="block two">
    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Susan: Free Tissues</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>You don't see them in Hong Kong or Singapore. A brilliant way of advertiseing.</li>
          <li>To advertise on everyday items--like fans in the summer--is something very Japanese. Although you do start to get desensitized...</li>
          <li>You never have to buy tissues again, and simultaneously saves you time because you don't have to go to the convenience store. </li>
          <li>There are busineess that revolve around the free stuff, like cases for these tissues.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Jay: "Tokyo" A Tsujiko Noriko Song</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Part of the album "From Tokyo To Naiagara"<a target="_blank" href=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvnTrlb9HEk”> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvnTrlb9HEk</a></li>
          <li>It dates back 11 years, still long before my 1st visit to Tokyo (8 years ago).</li>
          <li>I have been into electronica genre of music, Tujiko Noriko album and Aoki Takamasa she collaborated with.</li>
          <li>Discovered it through my Japanese-Polish girlfriend at that time.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Aimi: The "Tokyo Hiyoko"</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>One of the famous souvenirs of Tokyo, but is actually from a company in Fukuoka. </li>
          <li>The company sold them as Tokyo gifts at the 1964 olympics, and have been a Tokyo favorite ever since. </li>
        <li>That pettiness is something I portray of Japanese haha </li>
        <li>And the fact that, in the end, no one really cares is also very Tokyo-like haha </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Leo: Company Name Card Holder</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Truly an indicative item of the Japanese salaryman </li>
          <li>By wearing it around your neck, you are appealing to the world, "I work for this company". </li>
        <li>The fact that its around the neck is significant. Corporations in western countries have name cards too, but they usually don't resemble a leash haha </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <br>
    <p>Round 3: Each member is starting to roll. Then Susan presents, puts a new light on a side of Japanese society, and Aimi and Leo are aghast...</p>

  <div class="block two">
    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Susan: Mask</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Most people who have never been to an Asian country hold negative connotations towards these masks.  </li>
          <li>However in Japan, many people where them to warm up, for hayfever, or just to hide the fact they aren't wearing make up. </li>
          <li>It also proves how the Japanese work too much. In Australia, you can easily "check a sicky" and call in sick for work. </li>
          <li>But in Japan, people go to work wearing masks, even if they feel a little sick. And everyone around them will wear them too, for prevention.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Jay: Shochu</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>In general as it's so unpopular in the west and so much unlinked to Japan.</li>
          <li>Everyone thinks Japan = Sake when talking about alcohol. </li>
          <li>Yet again stereotypes clash with the reality. </li>
          <li>I like this brand for its lovely label design.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Aimi: A superball with a panda inside</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>This has more to do with the place I bought it than the thing itself: Ueno, with its park, zoo, and museums. </li>
          <li>Pandas are the bear of China, but when it first came to the zoo in Japan, everbody tried to make money by merchandising off of it. </li>
          <li>And almost all the merchandise is made in China, which is ironic. It doesn't even matter!! haha </li>
          <li>（Everyone's opinion）When the panda was about to have a baby, it was national news. It's all really a part of this obsessive fad culture of Japan.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Leo: Maccaron Bubble Bath Mix</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>First of all, the Japanese love baths. </li>
          <li>But making bubble bath mix in the shape of a maccaron=very Japanese. They like making everything look like food.</li>
        <li>Then there is the "Kawaii" culture, and the ever prevalent idolization of western culture mixed in too. </li>
        <li>Baths + Food + Kawaii + Western = The perfect Japanese girl object haha</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Susan: Sounds of Nature (via iPhone）</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>You can hear "sounds of nature" throughout Tokyo</li>
          <li>In many cases they are artifical sounds.</li>
          <li>Since it is such a metropolis, everyone seems to have a longing for nature.</li>
        <li>Like the <a target="_blank" href=“http://www.worldintwelve.com/en/matrix/tokyo_x_whats_beauty”>"Otohime"</a> in the bathrooms, Japanese people might be very sensitive to sound.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Jay："No Purpose" Book</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Somehow the reason I came here or rather an excuse. </li>
          <li>The body of work that consumed last 6 months of my life here and allowed me to explore cities day to day vibe, practices, pace; far from stereotypical hectic living.</li>
          <li>The book consists of 64 images.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="inner-block">
      <p>
        <em>Aimi: Psyllium</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Originally from the idol concerts held in Akihabara. The fans would hold the colors of their favorite idols. </li>
          <li>However these psyllium sticks can now be seen at every and any concert.</li>
       <li>There are many different types of sticks, from longer lasting ones with weaker light, to 5 minute bright sticks meant for one song only. </li>
       <li>Hardcore fans use the different types depending on occasion.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>Leo: Incense</em><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Tokyo is a surprisingly scentless city for being so big. However, if you go to Asakusa, you can smell incense. </li>
          <li>Japanese like "no smell". There is even a deoderant with the smell, "no smell". </li>
        <li>People don't wear much perfume either. </li>
        <li>However the one smell that I feel <i>is</i> Japanese is the smell of incense. </li>
        </ul>

Aimi and I were cohords at TV Asahi, and her being in the art department (and previously an art student) we did a lot of viewing, talking about, and creating art together!!

    <p><em>Susan Bui</em><br>
      A native of Australia, I met Susan through Lana when she was a resident artist at 3331 Arts Chiyoda. Susan's viusal art is all so eccentric, yet has many hidden layers of fun, it really makes you excited to see them. In the Treasure Box Battle, she gave incredible insights about Japanese society, it just had me nodding the whole time haha. Hope to see you soon, Susan! <br>

      Jay is a photographer introduced to me through Sayaka. Originally from Poland, Jay has lived all over the globe, from Denmark to Singapore, and now Tokyo.

    <p><em>Leo Kominz</em><br>
     After conducting the pilot version of Treasure Box Battle in Tokyo, I have fully realized that my senses are completely lacking in all cylinders compared to actual artists. And it scares me shitless to think of what's to come, out there in the world. However, doing the Battle reinforced the feeling that, yes, it <i>is</i> interesting to look through a city and society through a single object, and it was fun. And this paragraph is getting a little too serious so I will stop now.
