    <p><em>Q1：What is "beauty" to you? </em><br>
         A："Something resemling an aura"<br>
         →I believe beauty is something you can just sense from someone’s presence/attitude, kind of like an “aura” exonerated from within. It is definitely something unique to each individual, and it becomes apparent when someone is truly being themselves. Some qualities I find in a ‘beautiful person’ is that they are trustworthy, passionate, comfortable in their own skin, righteous & caring. I also find people who have love for another very beautiful. And the world is more beautiful when there is love for another! (I sound like such a hippie haha)

    <p><em>Q2：Where do you think is beautiful in Tokyo?</em><br>
         A："Yoyogi Park!!"<br>
         →I find Japan a country of exquisite nature – beautiful in all four seasons...  and living in Tokyo, Yoyogi-park is the closest and most convenient place in the city I can really experience this. In the spring the cherry blossom bloom all over the park, in the summer I love chilling by the fountains and grass fields, in the fall the autumn leaves are absolutely beautiful, and in the winter, the air is clear and I love walking under the blue sky. It's also just a really interesting place to people-watch the locals too. When I feel stressed at work, have something on my mind, or just overwhelmed by the city-life in general, I like to take a stroll in the park to refresh my mind! I feel very fortunate that there’s such a beautiful park accessible in the midst of the hustle and bustle of a big city.

    <p><em>Q3：Who of your friends do you believe is beautiful？And plese introduce her to us!! </em><br>
         A："Marie Fujisawa"<br>
         →Mari Fujisawa. I first met Mari three years ago when I moved to Tokyo from the US. We were colleagues as well as friends - spent a lot of time together on the job, as well as outside of work. She’s half Japanese, half American. She hardly ever wears makeup (!!) and she’s absolutely gorgeous! Not only is she a beautiful on the outside, over the past few years of getting to know eachother, I have learned how great of a friend she is to me and others around her, and how honest/kind-hearted she is. Mari is a great person who defines beauty, both on the inside and out.
