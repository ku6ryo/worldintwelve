    <p><em>Q1：What is "beauty" to you? </em><br>
         A："Something resemling an aura"<br>
         →The natural appeal of something. Something that is original or unique to that person, and comes out when that person is truly being his or herself. When I look at the people around me, the people are trustworthy, that believe in themselves, have confidence, are good human beings--those are the beautiful people. Oh, and also people who have love? (愛がある?) And I believe the world is a beautiful place because love exists! And now I sound like a hippy! Haha

    <p><em>Q2：Where do you think is beautiful in Tokyo?</em><br>
         A："Yoyogi Park!!"<br>
         →Why? Because one of the things I'm grateful for while living in Tokyo is that there are the four seasons, and the place where I feel it the most is in Yoyogi Park. In the spring there are the cherry blossoms, in the summer the grass and springs are relaxing, in the fall the autumn leaves are absolutely beautiful, and in the winter, the air is clear and I love walking under the bright blue sky. Its even just fun people watching with everyone having fun, going at their hobbies. When work is stressful or even when I just have free time, I come here to reset and recharge. I feel very fortunate that a place with so much nature exists in the middle of Tokyo.

    <p><em>Q3：Who of your friends do you believe is beautiful？And plese introduce her to us!! </em><br>
         A："Marie ◯◯◯"<br>
         →Marie was a colleague of mine when I moved to Tokyo three years ago at my first job. We were in the same department, and hanged out a lot off of work too. In the three years I've seen so many different and wonderful sides of her. She is half Japanese and half American, and possesses a natural beauty--I mean, I think I've only seen her with makeup two or three times a year!--and has such a pure heart!! I couldn't believe people could be so pure!! Marie is a great friend who defines beauty, both on the inside and out.
