    <p><em>Q1：What is "beauty" to you?</em><br>
      A：「The abilitiy to combine」<br>
         →I believe that beauty is the abitliy to combine。When you look at plants or nature, or even landscapes, first there is the functional aspect of it, then its combined with beauty. There is even the saying, "The beauty in usage" I try to deeply capture and quesstion beauty in things, people, and happenings, not just superficial beauty that meets the eye.

    <p><em>Q2：Q2：Where do you think is beautiful in Tokyo?</em><br>
         A：「The Hara Meuseum」<br>
         →The Hara Museum used to be a someone's personal mansion, and there is a nice cafe facing the garden. When you confront art, I believe one feels many aspects of beauty. There are the things you can't see--the thought behind the artwork, what might have been lost. The piece it self might be shocking, but I think there is always a "beautiful sight" that exists. It's also where I had my wedding, so I may be a little biased, but I do reccomend it very much.

    <p><em>Q3：Who of your friends do you believe is beautiful？And plese introduce her to us!!</em><br>
         A：「Iria Ashimine」<br>
         →Currently my friends and I are runnging a space called PROTO in Yutenji until the end of March 2015. The first floor is a gallery, the second a salon for registered members, and the third is a shared office where I have my press room for 3D printers. Iria lives on the 4th floor, which is a share-house, and we often eat hot pot together there. At first sight I could tell she was a designer, which she is for the accessary brand "otana," and her desk is by far the prettiest with all these shiny objects splattered around! Both the way she works and her creations are very interesting!!
