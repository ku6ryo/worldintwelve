    <p><em>Q1：What is "beauty" to you? </em><br>
         A："The true essence of things"<br>
         →I really didn't know how to put into words, but one thing I do believe is that outer beauty derives from inner beauty. The beauty of humans, and all animals really, both rely on the beauty on the inside, both physically and spiritually. This is true for man made objects too, where the materials used in creation affects the products' beauty.

    <p><em>Q2：Where do you think is beautiful in Tokyo?</em><br>
         A："...The department store bathrooms!"<br>
         →Maybe not the ideal answer haha. But I couldn't really think of anywhere that the scenery or landscape is trule beautiful...(I don't really like nightscapes) That's when department store bathrooms popped into my head! I've traveled to many countries, and I can definitely say Japan's bathrooms are NO.1!! (Especially the girls room!) I doubt "Otohime" (the artificial sounds that the toilet makes to mask the sound of "using the restroom") exists anywhere else, and each toilet has its own special design!! I mean, the toilet I used today looked like it could be located in a Thai resort villa!!

    <p><em>Q3：Who of your friends do you believe is beautiful？And plese introduce her to us!! </em><br>
         A："Saori Hiramoto"<br>
         →When I first met her she had beautiful white skin like mochi!! And I must be honest, I remember thinking to myself, "her inner body must be beautiful too..." Another reason is because she is pursuing what she loves. In addition to her outer beauty, the way she displays herself, the way she talks is also very intelligent and elegant.
