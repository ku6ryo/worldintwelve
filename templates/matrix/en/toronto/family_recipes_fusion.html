  <div class="title">Toronto × Fusion Cuisine</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
    <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>Leo loves to eat, so he is doing various food related sub-projects in each city. For this one, he chooses a topic and does a little hands-on, "field work". Basically he goes to various resturants and eats!! Hurrah!!</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Theme</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>The theme for Toronto is fusion food. To be honest, before I arrived in Toronto, my image towards fusion food was pretty terrible. What I experienced in New York during my college years basically concreted this perception, where fusion food was food created by chefs who really couldn't make any Asian cuisine authentically, so they jumbled it all up and called it "fusion". However, this was Toronto, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldintwelve.com/ja/matrix/toronto_x_misc">the most diverse city</a> in the entire world. Completely different. The fusion food of Toronto derives from this extreme mix of cultures, and the free minds held by the young chefs who grew up with this background. Eh, words won't do any justice. Let's check it out. （※One point: The majority of these restaurants were chosen by the gourmand Steven Tanaka, who took me to many of these places. Thanks Steven!!）
    <br><br>
    <p>So the first place we visited was<a target="_blank" href="http://www.patoistoronto.com/#about">"Patois"</a>. It was newly opened, and one of the places Steven, the super foodie wanted, to check out himself, and thought would be a good introduction for me too. And as the previous sentence points out, before I arrived here, I didn't think fusion cuisine woiuld be the theme for Toronto. <br><br> All that I heard from Steven was that this restaurant was a Jamaican Chinese fusion, which to the new-to-Toronto Leo was just plain confusing, but soudned super exciting at the same time. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>We arrived early, but the place was already packed.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
  　<p>Using skateboard wheels for the spinning table...the essence of the playful nature of fusion cuisine!! </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This was our first order, "Jerk Chicken Chaou-men". It had crunchy fried noodles and a muschroom sauce. Iside lay the Jamaican favoriete jerk chicken, and overflowing with cilantro. It had a bold flavor, but the sauce and chicken fit perfectly. And you know, cilantro goes with everything so lol</p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This was their signature menu, "Jerk Lobster". I mean lobster is delicious in basically any form, but with garlic, butter, and spices?? That's not fair!! The lime juice and cilantro also was a nice accent, and was a heavenly experience. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois5.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This was the "Pineapple-bread Burger". There aren't any pineapples in the burger itself, but instead of ordinary buns, it uses pineappe-bread, a chinese pastry. The buns are sweet, the meat is savory, and the cole slaw crunchy--another item which teases your taste buds. </p>
    <br>
  <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois6.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>When Steven told one of the waiters about my project, Craig, the owner-chef came out to greet us. Craig's parents are from Hong Kong, and Craig loved to play with his food since his childhood. He was working at a Michelin starred restaurant in Lyon, when one day he realized, upscale French cuisine wasn't really his thing. So he ruturned to Toronto, mixed his roots (Hong Kong) with his love (reggae and Jamaica) and made this restaurant. Yup, this! This is exactly what I was looking for. The fusion food of Toronto. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois7.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Before we left, Craig said "Hey I cooked up something for you!" and gave us the meal below. It was great to be able to finish off the meal with white rice (me being Asian and all haha). It was an incredible first experience with the fusion food of Toronto.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/patois8.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>= = = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>The following day, I went to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.banhmiboys.com/">"Banh Mi Boys"</a> for lunch. This eatery was recommended to me from not just Steven but a bunch of people.</p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/bmb1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The base of the food served here is obviously banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich. The interior was fast-food esque. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/bmb2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>But what is fasciating about Banh Mi Boys is the freedom it has towards its creations. I heard it was created by three boys who had parents running a banh mi shop, and they decided to make their own, combining everything and anything that they thought would taste good together. </p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/bmb3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The outer layers can be bagguetes, tortiyas or ever baos. Inside can be a variety of meats, fish, and vegetables. I didn't eat it this time, but the Kimchi Fries, their take on the Canadian poutine, is a popular item. </p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/bmb4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I ordered the Kalbi Banh Mi. </p>
    <br>
   <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/bmb5.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The kalbi had the korean bbq sweet sauce, the kimchi was spicy, the traditional banh mi-style pcikles the right amount of sour, the cilantro and its amazing scent, the mayonaise...aaahhhhh it was AMAZING!! Creating a harmony in your mouth...I came here a few times during my stay. I couldn't not to. I want a branch in Tokyo.  </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/bmb6.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>= = = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>When I next met Steven, he told me "We're going to try a bunch of places tonight!!" Check out numerous fusion restaurants in one night...?? This man was the real deal!! </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The first place we went was the newly opened <a target="_blank" href="http://www.torontolife.com/daily-dish/openings/2015/01/30/introducing-hanmoto-little-portugal-izakaya-oddseouls-co-owner/">"Hanmoto"</a>, a Japanese version sister restaurant to the famous "Odd Seoul". It was difficult finding the place, and it was -20 degrees celcius, and we were lost, so when we finally found the shop I was too happy I forgot to take a picture of the entrance. So here is the menu!!</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>As you can tell from the menu, and from the lighting and interior, this was not your ordinary Japanese restaurant. It felt more like a hole-in-the-wall eatery in Hong Kong or Southeast Asia. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto2.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>Very interesting vibe to the place.</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto3.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>So this was the first item, the signature "Uni Bomb". You wrap the sea urchin, scallions, wasabi, and fried bonito flakes in seaweed and eat. It was weird, but good!!  </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto4.jpg"></p>
      <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto4.5.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>"Eggplants with Dengaku Miso". Very unlike any Dengaku dish I had ever eaten. My grandmother would be in disbelief. However, the crunch deep-fried red things (peppers?) gave it an interesting texture, and it was very tasty. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto5.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>The box below contained "Chicken Wing Gyoza". This dish too was thoughtfully crafted, and the handles were in fact chicken wing, but what you ate was sort of a minced chicken ball stuck to the wing. It was easy to eat, which was nice, and obviously mayonaise and sweet sauce always tastes good. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto6.jpg"></p>
      <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto6.5.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>The last dish was the "Pork Cutlet Sandwich". The pork was pork belly, the new fad in North America, and honestly was kind of heavy. It felt like eating MOS burger in Japan. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/hanmoto7.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>= = = = =</p>
    <br>
    <p>We drove a little, and arrived at the previously mentioned <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/oddseoul-toronto"> "Odd Seoul"</a>. The menu here too was very simple. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/os1.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>Saturday night. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/os.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>Being Korean Amercan fusion, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blogto.com/restaurants/oddseoul-toronto">"Odd Seoul"</a> had an interesting decor.</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/os2.jpg"></p>
      <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/os3.jpg"></p>
     <br>
     <p>This is their signature item, "Squash Poutine". Poutine is usually made from potatoes, but they use squash here, which frankly, I thought was much better. They put curry and kimchi on top of the squash, and scallions, mayonnaise, and red pickled ginger. This was one of my favorite foods in Toronto. Super junky, and simply amazing. </p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/os4.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>"Bulgogi Cheese Steak". A spin on the traditional Philly Cheese Steak, with the steak being Bulgogi. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I felt it was just OK. </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/os5.jpg"></p>
     <br>
　　<p>= = = = = =</p>
 <br>
　　<p>The last place we went was one of the bars Steven frequents, the <a target="_blank" href="https://416snackbar.wordpress.com/le-menu/"> "416 Snack Bar"</a>. This place too serves fusion snacks that go with alcohol.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/4161.jpg"></p>
     <br>
    <p>Again, all these places were full.</p>
    <br>
 <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/4162.jpg"></p>
    <br>
<p>The menu. They really like simple menus at these types of shops.</p>
<br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/4163.jpg"></p>
<br>
    <p>This was the "Eggplant Sandwich". I don't have much memory of this dish other than "More eggplant!!" haha</p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/4164.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>Being the third restaurant, we were relatively full. So for the last item, Steven ordered one of his favorites, the "Pork Belly Bao". This was really good, I just wish I had it on more on an empty stomach. lol </p>
    <br>
     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/fusion/4165.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p><br><br>
    <p><em>Final Thougts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So how was it?? A lot of creative, original recipes to say the least, I hope. The two that really stood out for me was Odd Seoul and its Squash Poutine, and Banh Mi Boys and its entirety. You could just feel the "What? The cullinary rules and traditions of cooking? Fuck that!!! Son, we're making what WE think tastes good. That's all that matters." vibe in each dish, and all that you could say to that is "You are so totally and absolutely right". So as I brought a fork full of kimchi and squash to my mouth, the what came to my mind was "How do I bring this to Japan?" haha. The end!! </p>
