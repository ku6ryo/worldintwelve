  <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>Leo loves to eat, so he is doing various food related sub-projects in each city. For this one, he meets people living in each city, and has a home made meal!</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>Who I Met</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So for Toronto I met (or technically stayed with for my entire durations) was TobyとNancy Condliff. Toby is actually my great step-uncle. Yeah, a little complicated, but he is my grandmother's second husband's nephew! Yeah!! When I was looking for places to stay in Toronto, Toby sent me a notice saying that they had many rooms in their house that they could set me up in. With their children all out ot the house, and a magnanimous sense of hospitatlity, Toby and Nancy have guests over all the time. I acutally met 3 other people during my stay, all super friendly folks. Not only did Toby and Nancy let me stay at their place, they gave me the "Feel free to have dinner with us, whenever you like!" card. So I used that on a few occasions, which is the base of this project. A million thank yous to both Toby and Nancy!! (FYI: Toby is originally from the US but has lived in Toronto for 40 years, and Nancy is a native of Ontario)</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>So the Condliffe house is about a 10 minute walk from St. Clair station on the yellow subway line. Just a few stops from central Toronto, the house was extremely conveniently located. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>So I had my first dinner with them the day I arrived in Toronto. "I hope you're a carnivore" were the first words I conversed with Nancy haha. The meal was roast beef, mixed greens, and yams!! </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Dessert was apple crumble and vanilla ice cream. Mmmmm, North American cuisine at its finest!!</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Another day, I tried to help out Nancy a little with dinner. Nancy is a renown hand surgeon, and also teaches at the University of Torotno. And, she also makes dinner. Basically, I was witnessing greatness.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This furnace, according to Nancy is halogen? or something of the sort that does not exist anymore. She says no one can fix it if it breaks, but in the mean time, it seems to be doing ok. Although in truth it was a little difficult to maneuver... (the curries I made turned out a little watery lol). </p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/meal1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The Condliffe dinner usually revolves around the basic dietary concept of meat + vegetables + carbo haydrates. This day's vegetables were brocolli!! </p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/meal2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
　　　<p>The carbs came from two varying types of mashed potatoes (the sweet potatoes were delicious)</p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/meal3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>The meat was roast pork, wrapped in good old, never-lets-you-down Canadian baocn!! </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>A special utensil used to check if your meat is cooked. </p>

    <br>
    <p>The Condliffe dining room, very comfortable. </p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/kitchen1.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>We each had our set seat, and set tableware. </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Let's dig in!! </p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/meal6.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>This is what it looks like on a plate. According to Toby, roast pork and apple sauce go hand in hand, and when in Rome, do as the Romans do. And yes, we all know cooked meat and fruit make a wonderful pair, the ultimate combination of savory and sweet. The roast pork was definitely one of the best porks I've ever eaten in my life, with every ounce of my slab being juicy and tender (that is hard to come by). And obviously the bacon helped with the experience haha.  </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Lastly, I had one meal after returning from Japan (the wedding hiatus). It was late, so I had what was left over, but it was a novel experience. </p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/canadianrice3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>At first I was like, "what is this?? Some sort of chicken fried rice??" but in actuality, it was this thing called Canadian Wild Rice. Below is it in its raw form.</p>
    <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/family_recipes/tobyandnancy/canadianrice2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>You prepare it like normal rice, and the Canadain way (?) is to eat it with chicken, I guess. It was an interesting ingredient to say the least, with a different texture and flavor than rice. It was much more squishy, close to a popping sensation in your mouth, and overall, much more sweeter than normal white rice. However, although it was different, it was very, very good!! The saltiness of the chicken really fused well with the special sweetness of the wild rice. It was a new experience, but definitely one I'd like to try again. </p>

    <br><br>
    <p><em>Final Thoughts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So I had many of the standard, Canadian meals with Toby and Nancy in Toronto, which was nice because all that I cooked for myself is either curry or hot pot haha. It also made me realize how good a lot of these roast meats were, especially done well, and that I truly do like all and every sort of cuisine. Thank you again Toby and Nancy, not just for the meals, but for my entire stay!! </p>
