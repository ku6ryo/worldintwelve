    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：24　Years in Toronto： 6<br>
     <br> 
      Desmond was introduced to me through a high school friend James. I met Desmond a couple of times, and both times had one thing in common…MEAT. This man loves to eat meat, and I love him for that—hot dogs, beef sandwiches, poutine…oh all those oiled up carbohydrates and juicy MEATS that we ate…so bad for our body, so good for our soul…(I think all you left-wing food liberalists might want to skip this one lol. I love you guys and your food too though :) ). Desmond also answered the questions with simplicity and utmost honesty, and I burst out in laughter a number of times during the session. I recommend his close country (Q.2), wake up/go to sleep (Q.10), moments (Q.11), and dreams (Q.12). So Desmond, it was nice meeting you, and I hope you get to Tokyo soon and I’ll show you around all the great…wait for it…MEAT of Japan!! Haha

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
So right now we are at a restaurant/bar sort of establishment called WVRST. I chose it because it's my favorite place to get food, and be happy. Just be happy, it makes me happy. speaker 2: All right. I want you to be happy. </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  I would most likely want to go to Tokyo. I'm actually… I'm actually planning to go there this summer, but if I was given like, a bunch of money and a plane ticket or whatever, I'd just fly to Tokyo and… ideally, I'd get some sort of job there. I just want to experience life…like a Tokyo person. Yeah, but, yeah other than trying to work as a Japanese person… I'm not--that came out wrong--other than trying to work as a person that, as a normal resident of Tokyo, I'd just see sights and eat a lot. I like eating. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  Closest to…definitely not China despite being Chinese. I would probably say the States since it's the most culturally similar to Canada, sadly. 
<br><br>
>>> This is what I want to hear from Canadians! Haha 
<br><br>
 Yeah, sadly (Laughs). All our TV shows are American, all the movies we watch are American. We're basically like an extension of America, basically. Oh…Canadians are not going to be happy. (Laughs).

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
One thing? Streetcars. (Leo laughs). Streetcars, definitely streetcars. For a place?…for a place that represents more the people, other than like, just the usual touristy spots… I'd say Trinity-Bellwoods. When I think of Toronto, I think of like, a relatively young population, and really outdoorsy types and Trinity-Bellwoods seems to collect a lot of diverse people for going on picnics and stuff, just enjoying the outdoors. Only in the summer though, I don't know… I don't know what's there in the winter.

    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
     I would not do it, but if I were to do-if I were to do it… I'd make it a little more colorful. Right now it's just red and white, and it's just a, just a little bit boring. (Laughs).
<br><br>
>>>Is there a color you would add? 
<br><br>
 Not blue (laughs), because that would just turn it in to the American flag. (Leo laughs)… Maybe red is the best color, but that's maybe just cause I grew up thinking of Canada as red and white. Maybe green but that would probably just ruin the flag. That's why I would not design it-I would not redesign it. Yeah, I would not. 

 </p>

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
 Lake Ontario (laughs). I know it's not an ocean but that's the image I think of cause there's all lake shore here in Toronto. 
<br><br>
 The Sun<br>
(Thinking)… Just a really bright light. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
(Thinking) Black, graveyard, night time. The usual, yeah. Nothing particularly glamorous about death in my head. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 Personally for myself, I am fairly optimistic about my future…I think my life is on a good track. For mankind in general, there could definitely be some improvements like, of course there are all these issues like, overpopulation and global warming and all these things that we have to worry about. But it's not something that I personally have to worry about. It's more of a, a humankind sort of thing, where we're gonna to face a lot of significant challenges over the next few centuries. But I'm in a good spot.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Um… I guess being honest with myself. I value honesty a lot. So I don't want to… I never want to live in a way that, like… I want to be proud of what I, of the way I turned out so to speak. Like I don't want to look back on my life in the future and think, "You could have done better or been more true to yourself" (Laughs).

 </p>
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 (Laughs). Well there's honesty of course, that's probably one of the most important things. Just be open, like you don't have to be completely open, but… just it's, it's difficult to be in a relationship where the other person feels closed off and you feel like you're being shut out. So being reasonably honest and open and loyal. I think those are most important. I've only been in one relationship so, my sample size is not too big, but… that's generally what I look for. Yeah, based on my limited experience. It was a really long term relationship, though. It lasted like, almost four years.

  </p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/desmond/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yeah <br>
Children:  It's not a solid yes, right now it's more of a sure, why not sort of thing. 
<br><br>
>>>Sure… why not? Okay. 
<br><br>
 (Laughs) That sounds really bad, when it comes out like that haha.
<br><br>
 When it comes to, raising them, I just, I guess I just want to make sure that they're not limited by the way I raise them. But I don't want them to be, I wouldn't-I don't want to be the kind of parent where I'd be, "Oh you must learn piano and you must be really good at piano," or something stupid.
<br><br>
>>> Were your parents that way?
<br><br>
 A little bit. But, yeah I'd want them to be able to make their own choices, like not just in childhood, but for the rest of their life, so to speak. But as long as, as long as they don't you know, end up unhappy and stuff… all's fine. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 Uh, wake up to? Girlfriend (laughs), I'll be honest. Yeah, waking up next to a girlfriend is pretty nice. Especially if it's a long term serious thing, and you both like each other a lot. Fall asleep? Um… could you repeat that? Fall asleep part again?
<br><br>
>>>The instant before you fall asleep, the last thing you want to see. 
<br><br>
For some reason, falling asleep right after looking at the girlfriend doesn't seem as appealing as waking up to one. (Leo laughs)  I don't know why. So…probably like, a clean kitchen. I don't want to—I like going to sleep and knowing that I don't have to do random crap the next day to clean up.  (Leo laughs again).  So just clean kitchen, clean house, so I can go to sleep at peace (laughs)
 </p>

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
The happiest moment of my life was, well happiest/most exhilarating was probably when I found a rare item in an online game.  (Leo laughs).  I spent several days just like, repetitively, repetitively pressing a button to try to get this item, and when I final-when I finally got it, I just screamed really loud and like jumped around the house. It was a Ghostring card and this game was Ragnarok on line. (Leo still laughing). (Desmond laughs). I played that game a lot when I was in high school.
<br><br>
Yeah. Oh, and most terrifying moment. Ummm…(thinking)…this one's difficult. Yeah… I don't have a particular moment that strikes me as most terrifying or… I guess usually it would be, it could be something related to embarrassing moments, but nothing has ever happened that badly. More of a fear of how something could happen if I were to do something, I don't know. It's kind of vague, but yeah. That's the closest thing I could think of, I'd wake up from a dream, and I'd be, "Oh that didn't happen," sort of thing. 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
  (Thinking)… I was a pretty boring kid. I don't know if I had a dream…(thinking)…I don’t know if I had an actual concrete dream when I was a kid, asides from making money? (Laughs) Its a silly dream, I think. But…I’ve told this to other people before, but if I could do…actually I don’t agree with what I just thought of. I was going to say I would like to be a musician but when I think about it realistically I don’t think I like music enough to spend a lot of time practising. So its probably not…I think I like the idea of music, and playing music but, I don’t like practising. I think that’s pretty normal but…yeah. Its not a dream I could see myself fulfilling. Its a, sort of a “That would be really cool” kind of dream. Being a rockstar, or something, for example. Or a professional athlete. I don’t know. They seem interesting, but I don’t see myself putting in the dedication for it. 
<br><br>
>>>So what is your dream now?
<br><br>
Would it be super vague if I just said I wanted to be happy? (Laughs) 
<br><br>
>>>No its perfect. Because why did we come here, to WVRST? Because it makes you happy!!
