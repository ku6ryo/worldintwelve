    <p><span class="name">Han Dang and Bernard Chan</span></p>
    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：Han: 35, Bernard: 38 　Years in Toronto： Han: Over 10, Bernard: All his life<br>
     <br> 
Han and Bernard were introduced to me through Steven. I had dinner with them one night at a nice restaurant, and Han was super nice and invited me to her birthday party. Han’s birthday party was truly “Toronto” with every mix of race, nationality, and type of person attending. I remember I had a very thought provoking conversation with a half-Indonesian, half-African friend, after talking with an Indian British woman, followed by a Polish and Canadian couple. Crazy. Han and Bernard are also a true Toronto couple, with each being of different Asian descent, and having cool, free thinking opinions on a variety of topics (as you’ll see in the answers!). It was a lot of fun talking with them, and Bernard (or B, as we call him), gave me some of the kindest words I’ve received regarding my project. As for the answers, this was the first and last time where its a combination of two different interviews put into one, with Han and Bernard answering each question separately. It ended up being vary interesting, because you can directly compare the similarities and differences—almost like one of those Buzzfeed articles that compares genders and generates a lot of hits haha. Read whichever one interests you!! (I personally liked the flag (Q.4)) Anyway Han and B, thanks so much for everything, and we’ll meet up the next time you come to Tokyo!! 


</p>
       <br>
    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
 HAN: Yeah. Yeah. So this is our home. We’ve… lived here for six years, and to us, like there’s a lot of meaning to it because we’ve done a lot of renovations to the house.
<br><br>
>>>Oh, so that’s why its so new! 
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah, so in downtown Toronto, all the homes are pretty much old. Right? So a lot of the homes, they look old on the outside, but when you go inside, it‘s all renovated. Because the homes are about a hundred years old. So the home itself we decorated, we renovated. A lot of stuff in this house is custom made. So it’s basically our vision  and what we want.
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: It's my home. Yeah. It's my home. Right near Greek town. Close to downtown, but also a little bit away so you don't have to deal with the hustle and bustle all the time. And lots of food. Lots of different kinds of food.

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/hanandbernard/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 HAN: I would go to Europe. I would go to…It’s between Italy or Paris, but I think I would do Italy. I would want to go and  rent a villa somewhere near the water, and I would want to eat authentic Italian food for the whole month, interact with the locals, right? And I want them to know some English, but not that great, so you‘re sort of struggling with it, and just that whole experience of it. Like, I would love that! That would be my dream.
 <br><br>
 <br><br>
BERNARD: $2,500 or $25,000?
<br><br>
>>>Sorry. $2,500. (I accidentally said $25,000. Bernard laughs)  
<br><br>
I've been to Tokyo. And I love Tokyo. I've also been to Thailand, Bangkok. And those are the two places that I would go back. Just different culture from Canada. Very polite. Very organized. And for Thailand, just the weather. Amazing. That's something that everybody here dreams about. And you have it right there, pretty much all year round. So, those would be the places I would go.
<br><br>
>>>Two weeks each?
<br><br>
Two weeks each. I’d be eating a lot of ramen in Tokyo.


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  HAN: (Thinking)…I would say Costa Rica. We got married there. The food was amazing. The people were just so open and friendly and just so hospitable. And it’s beautiful! Like all the waterfalls… There’s volcanos. There’s nice, clean beaches. So I think it’s the people that really impressed us when we were in Costa Rica.
  <br><br>
  <br><br>
  BERNARD: Um… I'd say Taiwan. That's where my mom's from. I went back there. And I just feel really at home. And… great food, as well. It's all about the food. Right? And the people are very, very polite, very nice. So, that'll be my second home.

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/hanandbernard/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 HAN: (Thinking)… I would say Young and Dundas Square. It’s right downtown. Yeah, because there’s a lot of different types of cuisine there.  There’s  a lot of different types of restaurants.  You find people come there and… just to sort of explore Toronto, right?  You’re an outsider and just want to see what Toronto’s about. And I would say, yeah, like you can find pretty authentic restaurants within the vicinity of Young and Dundas Square. Like you can walk ten minutes any direction, and you’ll be able to find something good.
<br><br>
>>>Is there a thing? 
<br><br>
God ! (Thinking) A thing ?  Like, can I say diversity?
<br><br>
>>>I’m not supposed to tell you this, but that’s what every single person has said. (Laughs)
<br><br>
(Laughs) Yeah. It’s diversity, and it’s just friendliness. Yeah.
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: It's definitely the multi-culturalism. That's really what Toronto is about. You walk down the street. If you're not used to it, you see colors. But if you live here, you don't see any colors at all. You just see another Torontonian group. Anywhere you go, there's… very little bias or racism. Right? That's really what Toronto’s about. Everyone has their rights to do whatever they want. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there a place that represents that?
<br><br>
(Thinking) If you go downtown, you see every ethnicity. Pretty much. That's pretty much the core. It's like a fruit punch.



    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    HAN:  I would probably make the flag just white because…. white is just a blank canvas. And anyone is welcome and everyone is welcome. And it could be anything and everything. 
    <br><br>
    <br><br>
BERNARD: A polar bear. A fierce polar bear. Because the flag is so shitty. (Leo bursts into laughter) Yeah. So, we would use something a little more fierce. Canada has always been known as the good guys and the little brother of the US. And a polar bear would probably change people's perceptions of Canada. Maybe a little blood. Maybe a little...
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) Keep the red.
<br><br>
Keep the red around the mouth.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
 HAN:<br> 
 —The Ocean<br>
 Mermaids. (Both Laugh)
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
(Pause)…sand
<br><br>
>>>Sand? 
<br><br>
Yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Is that like the beach’s sand ?
<br><br>
I would say the beach… When I think of the sun, I would think of the beach and the water. (Thinking)… Just rebirth, new cycle of life.
<br><br>
>>>Could you elaborate on mermaids ?  I’m curious. 
<br><br>
Yeah, because, I don’t know…when I think of the ocean. It’s so deep. It’s so…It’s a mystery. Like not even scientists know what’s deep down there. And why can’t there be some creatures or something that we never have discovered?  Right? Why can’t mermaids exist?
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD:<br> 
—The Ocean <br>
(Thinking) Just vast and blue. It never ends. It goes very deep. And we probably don't know what's down there.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Life.
<br><br>
>>>That's pretty self-explanatory. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Transition.
<br><br>
>>>Okay. Thank you. Is there anything you want to add, to any of the answers?
<br><br>
Well, to death, really. Because I know a lot of people fear death. But... Is it? Are they fearing it because of the unknown? Because we really don't know what the hell happens after. We really don't know. So, I don't fear death. I just look at it. Do you fear birth? Nobody's scared of being born. What's the difference? Dying.

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
  HAN: Okay. Well, I am very optimistic about the future. I… as opposed to B (is what everyone calls Bernard).  The future doesn’t look like it’s going in a good direction to him. But for me, I have hope. Hope is very important for me. I think that if I live in a world where there is no hope, I don’t want to exist. So for me, I feel that it depends upon what you focus on. So there’s bad news, there’s good news. And if you choose to focus on the good news, then you’ll see the world in a better light. You’ll see the world in a brighter future.  That things are progressing, and they’re going the way that they’re supposed to go.
<br><br>
>>>Wow very interesting…  So that applies to both you and mankind? 
<br><br>
Yeah, so I’d  say there’s hope for mankind. I’d say that, I feel that there’s a war going on right now. There’s a lot of war all over the world. There’s different clashes of religion, beliefs, you know - greed for money, for oil. But I feel that that’s not it. Like that’s not all that’s out there, and that there are other people out there who believe in humanity, who believe in hope and who want to share, who would fight a good fight if they have to. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: Like images about flying cars? Or…?
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs) That works, too! 
<br><br>
I look at the future of humanity. We have a lot more… a lot more knowledge now. Especially with the internet and all the information we can access. But it's really… what's really going to change the world is how we use that knowledge now. Everything's in our control. Soon, they're going to landing on Mars.  So, we have the ability to do a lot of things we couldn't do. But I find that if you don't figure out what you want to do, you're never going to achieve it. And I find that because things are easy now, with the resources that we have, I tend to think that we abuse it. So, I wouldn't say the future's bleak, but I do think that we need to look at what we have and use it wisely.

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/hanandbernard/4.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
 HAN: Most important thing? …Is to live a good and happy life. It’s important for me, no matter, it doesn’t matter what I choose to do, that choice would make me happy. So it’s not just the end result, but it’s also the journey—that I’m also happy in that journey itself.
<br><br>
>>>Can you give an example?
<br><br>
Speaker 1: Yeah, like for example right now I’m pretty happy. I feel that if anything unfortunate, were to happen to me and I would cease to exist in this world the next day, I would feel complete. I would feel satisfied. I have a great family. I have wonderful friends. I live my life in a way where I don’t have regrets. And… and I have, like I feel there’s meaning to my life.
<br><br>
<br><br>
 BERNARD: For me? Fulfilment. You go through life. Everybody's working or…sorry (answers phone). Sorry.
<br><br>
>>>No problem. So, fulfilment?
<br><br>
Definitely fulfilment, happiness. There's a... You can achieve happiness by watching a movie, looking at the sunset, seeing a cat, little kitten, or little puppy. You can achieve happiness. But fulfilment is beyond happiness. It's a state versus a fleeting moment. So, that's what I really look forward to. Achieving fulfilment.
<br><br>
>>>Is there something in particular that you think represents that? 
<br><br>
I'd say fulfilment is really having the ability or freedom to do whatever you want at that point. So, for example, say if you're working and you were like, "Oh, I really wish I was on a beach." And you have that ability and that empowerment to just say, "Hey, you know what? I'm gonna go." That's fulfilment. If you're talking about health, not being sick. Be healthy enough to do whatever you want. Go wherever you want to go. We tend to not appreciate those moments of just brushing your teeth, washing your face, and just being able to walk outside the door. So, really, it’s freedom.



 </p>
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
  HAN: For me, humor, compassion, wits.  Okay. Because I can’t stand someone who’s stupid. (Laughs) And… just very kind and generous, right?  And a protector. Very important!
  <br><br>
  <br><br>
BERNARD: Compassion. Patience. Definitely an open heart is important. Because at the end of the day...this is for all the people that are going to be in relationships. (Leo laughs) Yeah. Just to let you guys know. There's going to be good times. There's going to be bad times. And it can be directly with your partner or by yourself. And the most important thing is having that person next to you when you're going up and down. Because when you're up, everyone's around you. People that you don't even know will be around you. But when things... When shit hits the fan, people start to show their true colors. So, when you pick a partner, when you choose a partner for life, be sure you pick one that will stick by you.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
>>>(Knowing previously from Steven that Han and Bernard made the decision not to have children) Could you explain your decision? 
<br><br>
 HAN: Yep. It was, you know, like a long, hard decision for us because we decided we had to access, you know, why do you like children, right?  Like, “do we want children because we were expected to have children?”. You know, the cycle of life, right? You’re born, you go to school, you get married and you have kids, you work until you’re 65, and then you’re sick and too old to do anything with all that money that you have. So we… I had to search myself. “Why do I want kids.” Is it because of pressure from my family or is it something that I really want? I’ve never felt that I have to have children of my own. I never felt that I need to become a parent to be happy. I felt that I am fulfilled and satisfied with other things in my life that I have going on. And we did talk about how if we ever wanted children, we can always adopt because I truly believe that we are able and capable of loving other kids just as we would love our own. So we don’t need to have blood- related kids, so...  
<br><br>
Also, another big thing for us was that I value freedom. I value flexibility, and having kids really ties you down, because you have to be structured. You can’t pick up and travel if you want to.  You can’t… do whatever you want, because then you become the kid, right? Like everything surround  your child because that’s your responsibility. So for me, one of the things that’s important for me is… freedom. And it’s hard to balance freedom and raise kids at the same time. Not that it’s impossible. But it’s a choice that we were willing to make.
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: Oh, yes. So we decided not to have children because we just didn't really want them. It's almost like asking somebody, "What do you want on your pizza?" Certain people say, "Hey, I want mushrooms." Some people don't. It's just really a preference. Nothing against people having children. It's just one of those things, we didn't want to do. And we didn't feel… We didn't want to fall into the pressure because parents around you will definitely pressure. Most of the parents will pressure you to have children. Friends will pressure you. Other people will pressure you because it's almost the norm. You go to school. You go get a job. Go get a place, car, get married, have children. And then do whatever you're supposed to do 'til you're 65 or whatever, retired. Retire and hopefully live the life that you dreamt about when you were probably 12 or something and you're pretty much near death. And then the cycle goes on. So, we decided, “Hey. You know what? We love our life right now. We love our lifestyle." We found the freedom to do whatever we want. And we decided we don't need a child. That was it.



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 HAN: I would have to say “Bernard.”  
<br><br>
>>>I’m glad the feeling is mutual. (Laughs)
<br><br>
(Laughs)  Oh, Good ! Yeah. So it’s…in the morning, when we wake up, we usually stay in bed. And I would roll around ’cause I love sleeping, and he would always wake up early, so sometimes he will poke my face and try to get me to wake up. And so we go through this thing. And just having fun, just enjoying the moment. Right? Like it’s nice to have him around. It’s nice to have your best friend and someone who makes you laugh, and you’re comfortable with, and just…. It’s a good feeling to start off your day with, and the same at night. And so ideally, he would be the perfect person. Right? For us to wind down, for us to recap, to talk about the day. And I can’t think of anything else that’s better.
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: Nothing. My wife. Seeing her sleeping brings a tranquil moment and, yeah, before bed. Because usually, I wake up earlier. I sleep later.  So, seeing her puts things into perspective. Doesn't matter what I have to do that day. I deal with a lot of stuff every day, a lot of problem solving. But, when you just see the one you love next to you sleeping and being so peaceful, it just brings you back down. You just realize… doesn't matter what happens. This person's still there. And you should be grateful.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
 HAN:  HAN: Okay.  The happiest?
<br><br>
>>>If you don’t have one, you can say, “I have many,” and just choose one to talk about. Some people do that.
<br><br>
Yeah...I feel like I have many. I would say (Thinking) …just  (Thinking)  maybe going to EOB, like that course, that self development course. And coming out of it, feeling like I’m on this mental high, and…because knowing that I came out from that course and have a greater understanding of myself on a level that’s so deep that I’ve never, ever knew. So… I think that was the happiest moment of my life.
<br><br>
>>>So, recently.
<br><br>
Yes. Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>All right. Most terrifying?
<br><br>
I think the most terrifying was when I got the phone call that my Mom was in the hospital, and she…. Yeah, like she passed out and went through a mild seizure, and she was in the hospital. My parents live in London, so they’re far away, like two hours away so I couldn’t be there. But that was probably the most terrifying moment.
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: I can't really think about the happiest moment. I think the happiest moment is looking forward to the next happiest moment. And the most terrifying moment was getting shot. That was about 10 years ago and during my partying days. Went to eat and after that, fight broke out. Guy came in, shot into the crowd and… I was shot in the arm. I don't know if you want to see this...(Shows scar) Yeah, a nice scar. In that moment, it was terrifying because I didn't know if he was going to continue shooting. I didn't know if anybody else died. It was just a surreal moment. You watch it on TV, but until it happens to you, you're just not... You don't expect that. 
<br><br>
>>>This was in Canada?
<br><br>
This was in Canada. That was probably the scariest moment. It's not so much the fear of death, it's the fear of not being able to fulfil all the things you wanted to do. And also, my parents. My parents and leaving my friends. So that was probably the most terrifying. …But, if you live through that, you live through a lot of other things. So, it's also a positive.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
  HAN: My childhood dream was to just have a good job, have… you know, get married, have 2.5 children, white picket fence. That was my childhood dream. That is no longer my dream. Because that’s not what I want. I realize that that was what I... the pressure of what I felt I should say and how I should live my life. So my dream now is to  really have enough  passive income where I don’t have to worry about work. I don’t have to worry about money, then I get to travel the world. I get to eat different food around the world, I get to experience different cultures, make new friends, take whatever classes, like cooking classes or whatever hobby that I decide to pick up… so just exploring what else is out there besides North America. 
<br><br>
>>>So what would you tell the child you?? 
<br><br>
I would tell her, that... (Thinking)... that, “Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, don’t be afraid to do something different, and don’t be afraid to go against the grain and what you are expected to do or have been told to do.
<br><br>
<br><br>
BERNARD: ...What was my childhood dream? (Thinking)… Play! Actually, that was my childhood dream. To grow up and play! Yeah. That was really it. I was a very creative child and I just enjoyed playing. And while everybody else was talking about becoming an astronaut, or whatever, I just wanted to play. I never understood what is was. I just loved to play. And I look at my life now.
<br><br>
>>>What were you playing with?? 
<br><br>
Anything. Toys, just running around, play in the backyard, bugs. It's really that sense of freedom, of just doing whatever you want without any thoughts of, "Hey, you know what? I can't do this because it's wrong,” or whatever it was. Look at my life now. I'm doing the exact same thing of fulfilling my dream because I get to do whatever I want. So…it's just a bigger playground now.
<br><br>
>>>You would tell the childhood you,  “you did it?”
<br><br>
I did it. I got new toys. It's really… having that freedom and the empowerment is priceless. You might never know what you truly want in life. But having the ability to go out there and look for it is something you don't want to miss.
