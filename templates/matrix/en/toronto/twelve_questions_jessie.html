    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：24　Years in Toronto： 6<br>
     <br> 
  Jessie was introduced to me through Desmond. Jessie is one of those girls with one of those charming personalities and wonderful smiles. She was also super kind enough to meet up with me a couple of times, helping out on various projects, and showing me around OCAD (Ontario College of Art and Design). OCAD itself has to be one of the weirder looking/architecturally bizarre buildings in not just Toronto but the whole world, which is kind of ironic because Jessie turned from a life of working after her architectural studies at U of T to creating animation at OCAD (which frankly, to me, seems like an awesome decision :) ) Jessie gave great answers throughout, and if I were to choose a number, they would be the flag (Q.4), the future (Q.6), her partner (Q.8), and her moments (Q.11). Jessie, see you around, and do come to Tokyo again when I’m there!! 

</p>
       <br>
    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
 Oh, this is OCAD University and it's where I go to school for my animation program. And yeah, it's a great place for me. I feel comfortable here and it’s… just full of creativity and it inspires me you could say.  </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
   Is this just me or can I bring friends along? (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>> I’ve never gotten that. (Jessie laughs) I guess they'd have to pay for themselves, and if they'd be willing, then yeah. 
<br><br>
Okay. I've always wanted to go to France, cause I don't know, I really like French culture. How much did you say? It was $2000? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. For a month. 
<br><br>
 For a month… Actually, I always wanted to go to Japan too, but I'm going there this year, so I feel like that doesn't really count. 
<br><br>
>>>So it's a month, what would you do?
<br><br>
What would I do there? For a month, actually, maybe not for a month (laughs).  Darnit. Okay, huh. 
<br><br>
>>>I guess you could do two weeks, two weeks. 
<br><br>
Oh… (Thinking)… Maybe I would go to somewhere super nature-y, somewhere more remote I guess. Somewhere a bit more spiritual, say a Shaolin temple in the mountains on the cliff side and just… use that time to I don't know, explore nature and meditate….Yeah, and explore the world that kind of thing. 


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  Country? I guess China, cause that's where my parents came from and I've been there a few times to visit. Um, yeah and I still identify with the culture there. 
<br><br>
>>>Where in China?
<br><br>
Northern China. 
<br><br>
>>>That's where your parents are from?
<br><br>
Yeah, yeah. 

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/jessie/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Okay, then I would say diversity and a general open-mindedness. You have all sorts of different people, and… that we feel connected to one another. 
<br><br>
>>>Very true. I've been writing about that. Is there a place that you visit that represents that? 
<br><br>
Place? … The subway system, because everyone goes through the subway system. 


    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
     Would people get mad at me if just re-designed it? They'll be like, ""Who is this girl that got rid of our maple leaf?"" (Laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs). You know, you'll have supporters too, let's just put it that way. 
<br><br>
Okay. Um, yeah I would design it like… I would say, right now it doesn't actually look that good. It's like a leaf, and it's got like these random chunks on the side. (Leo laughs) Um… I like minimal stuff, so I guess something with more negative space, but I guess also something that represents diversity so… a bit more color and… I’m trying to like make it with my hands (Everyone laughs). Yeah, yeah. I still want it geometric though. So simple shapes that come together.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Calming waves… I'm imagining that sound that “shhhhhh” sound.
<br><br>
Ohh! I haven't gotten anybody say sound before as the first image. 
<br><br>
 Huh, maybe I just miss the beach (Everyone laughs), being winter. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Uh well, I just said beach, so let me get that out of my mind. Um, warmth… specifically the sunshine that's on your face and just like feels nice, on your skin. 
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death? Okay… Um, I guess… (thinking)… emptiness…? A vagueness and emptiness. Or a cloudiness. 
<br><br>
>>>A cloudiness? 
<br><br>
I guess like the uncertain. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 Um… I feel excited for the future.  I think overall we're heading to good places and… it could be really interesting. I'm really interested in seeing what kind of technology emerges in the future and how it changes our lives. The computer only happened what a couple of decades ago? And look how much it changed everything and how we do things and little cultural things, and also how are people going to dress in the future? Will people look back today and be "Oh yeah 2000s, that was such a weird period. Let's have year 2000s party where we all dress up like we're from the 2000s!" (Laughs) Also I'm really interested in how the present looks to the future. Because you don't understand things until you've gotten past them. And… and yeah I think——well at least I'm hoping, that through social activism and whatnot, things will change for the better. I think I see that now, so I guess I'm excited to see those things play out into… better producing good results. A better future.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
That’s a tricky question. Hmm… I think as a person, your outlook on life is very important. Like, being able to see the bigger picture and where you fit into all of it, as well as appreciating the richness in mundane experiences. I used to keep a blog where I would write about the beauty in random stuff like broken plates, dry spaghetti, and even shower water. It was a lot of fun, but basically, it was about discovering happiness in simple pleasures. The world is shaped by how we see it, so I think it’s really valuable to see the good where there is good as well as ways in which things could always be better.

 </p>
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 Uh… (Laughs) a lot of things I guess. Well I try not to set um, specific standards because I don't think you should be looking for someone that fits into your standards. You should just like people for who they are. Um… but that being said, I like honesty and genuine… “genuinity", what's that word? 
<br><br>
>>> Genuinity? I’m not sure…
<br><br>
 Yeah, the noun for genuine. Um, but also weird. I like weird people. (Laughs) And open-minded and kind and someone who I can have a good time with, but also share intelligent conversations (laughs). Preferably, but I mean, ultimately I think I can like anyone, so.
<br><br>
>>>Do you have any specific definition of “weird”? 
<br><br>
Uh, quirky.
<br><br>
>>>Okay…(laughs) 
<br><br>
I feel like I'm kind of quirky, so it's just… you can bounce off of one another. 

  </p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/jessie/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Um…(laughs)…yes.
<br><br>
>>>You're saying “um”. Why “um”?
<br><br>
I don't know. I guess it's just… I say yes but I think you don't have to be married per se. 
<br><br>
Children: Yeah, I think so. 
<br><br>
 What would you do with them and what would you want them to be? Um… I want to have fun with them but raise them well. I guess I don't want them to grow up to be spoiled children. I want them to appreciate the things they do have. And I want them to, I guess be ambitious and look for, um… (thinking)… (laughs). I lost my train of thought. Yeah I want them to be… good and driven people who want to make the world a better place…oh, and take care of their parents when they're older. 
<br><br>
>>>(Laughs). I haven't gotten that one either which is, well, you would think a lot of people would say!


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Oh, okay… well when I wake up I like hearing birds and having it be sunny and stuff. You know, when you wake up naturally? Because it's like because the world woke you up and not just your stupid alarm at 6 a.m. or something. And then for falling asleep… you said it could be a sensation right? It could be an experience? A warm fluffy bed and you're freshly showered and everything feels so soft and dry. (laughs).

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/jessie/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
(Thinking)… Happiest moment? I don't know a specific moment that's the happiest… but I think, a general memory that gives me the most happiness is just being home for Christmas with my entire family. We're all just gathered around and doing something random, like trying to get a fire going or just eating food. Yeah, so the holidays in general. Especially now because we don't always get to get together every year. So those are really valuable to me. Um, then for the most terrifying experience? Okay. I think seeing my mom cry. That was a hard experience and also a big shock to me. 
<br><br>
>>>You don't have to tell us if uncomfortable but…why did she cry? 
<br><br>
I think it started with my younger sister and her getting into an argument… and from there things just escalated. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. It happens with daughters and mothers. I have one of each too so I understand…(Jessie laughs)


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
  Um, I think my childhood dream, other than to become a princess (Everyone laughs)…was to be an artist, and that's kind of what I'm doing now. But I would tell my younger self not to stray and to just keep drawing and keep working. Because I feel like I kind of strayed from that path and I only rediscovered it recently. And it's just, where would I be if I always kept on following it? And is there anything else to that question? 
<br><br>
>>>What's your dream now?
<br><br>
What's my dream now? Do awesome things (Laughs). 
<br><br>
>>>Awesome!!!
<br><br>
In anything, but I guess more art-related things. 
<br><br>
>>>Just in life. 
<br><br>
Yeah, in life.
