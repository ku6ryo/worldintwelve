    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：45　Years in Toronto： 27 years<br>
     <br>
     Joshua I met at Han’s birthday party. First I have to apologize: the banner picture of Joshua has him being really stern, but in fact he is super friendly, super nice, and smiling all the time. Its just it was the most fitting pic regarding size ratio...ah, excuses. I'm sorry! Anyway, as you can see, Joshua is an artist, and I was lucky enough to check out his studio and home located right by Lake Ontario. We had some nice tea, a few little sweet things (he had chocolate from Japan) , checked out his work, and talked about various topics ranging from Jackson Pollock to what its like to come from the French side of Canada. It was one of those fulfilling afternoons, where time runs slow, and everything is just tranquil. So tranquil, that we even took a picture using one of Joshua’s apps (he used to be a commercial photographer) that turned us transparent! (You can check out the pic below!) For Joshua’s answers, I would recommend the flag (Q.4), wake/sleep (Q.10) and the dream (Q.12). So Joshua, thanks for a great time, and next time I see you its going to be warmer in Toronto so we can check out the view of the lake from your place!! Haha :) See you around!

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
    Place: This is my working space. This is my studio. I do lots of my art over here, and this is where I express myself.</p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/joshua/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 Where would I go?  Um…(Thinking) New York. I would go to New York City. I mean, I know there’s lots of beautiful places, very exotic places… but personally I love the fast paced, I love when it‘s a little bit chaotic, and I think New York has that.  It’s the night life, and it’s the art scene, and the underground.  And there’s just so much to do in New York City, and every time I go there I totally enjoy myself. Now when I leave, I always would like to stay a little longer.
<br><br>
>>>Have you ever stayed there for a month?
<br><br>
No. (Laughs) The max I’ve been there was for about one week.
<br><br>
>>>Oh yeah, so it would be fun. That would be fun. 
<br><br>
Yeah. But I don’t know if 2,500 dollars would be enough. (Laughs)

 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  Closest? (Thinking) I don’t think there’s any place other than Canada that I feel close to that answers your question. It’s the only place I can see myself living in. I’ve visited the states— the U.S. quite often. I mean, if there was a place, I guess it  would be the U.S., but I don’t see myself anywhere else than Canada.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
 First thing that comes to mind would be the CN Tower, the Great Lake, Ontario Lake. I live right beside it. And to me that’s very much Toronto, I guess.
<br><br>
>>>So that would be both the thing and the place? Or that would be the place ?
<br><br>
The place?  CN Tower. That’s the first thing that comes to mind. It’s a landmark, and it’s … everybody knows Toronto for the CN Tower. Everybody who comes and visits Toronto, they all go to the CN Tower.
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
 I wouldn’t redesign the Canadian flag. I’m very proud to be Canadian. And I don‘t think there‘s anything to redesign about it, but if I had to, as an artist…
<br><br>
>>> Yes.
<br><br>
 I would take bold colors. Some blues and some greens and all kind of beautiful colors and just… like Pollock would do it.  We had a conversation about this! (Leo laughs) I would just slap on some paint because we live in a very multicultural place, especially Toronto.  And it would be to represent the world basically. But I don’t think it needs to be redesigned. It’s beautiful as it is.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Infinity. Horizon.
 <br><br>
>>>All right.
<br><br>
And it’s something. When I look in…when I do my work, and I create lots of water scenes and skies…I love the horizon, and it’s inspiring. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Power.
<br><br>
—Death <br>
(Thinking)  It’s pretty sad. (Both laugh)  Death…  It’s just sad. (Laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Just sadness.
<br><br>
Well, yeah.  I mean, it’s the end…the end of something. That’s the way I see it.
<br><br>
>>>End of our life as it is.  All right. Do you want to elaborate on power, or…?
<br><br>
In regards to the sun?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah.
<br><br>
Well it’s power. It’s the energy. It’s… uplifting.


 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 What do I see for the future? Um…I think as we go, I guess, it becomes more and more competitive in a way of…are we talking about workplace or….?  And…when I say more competitive, it’s becoming harder in getting what you want in a way, if it makes sense?
<br><br>
>>>Very interesting. Is that same thing for you or just in general, do you think ?
<br><br>
Um, I don’t really know how to answer that question, to be honest with you.
<br><br>
>>> All right Yeah. That’s great. That’s very interesting.
<br><br>
No, it’s… (Thinking)  Yeah…. No, I don’t know. (laughs)

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Family. That’s something that would come across. My relationship, my family.  Well-being. Health.

</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Well, kindness.  I look for someone that we…a good relation. And somebody that can understand, communicate. It’s very important.
  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/joshua/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: At this time, no. But I’m open to it. If it comes down to it… but I’m very happy the way things are right now. But I’m…no objection. Like again, It’s legal. (Laughs)<i> [Note: “Legal” referring to gay marriage in Canada]</i><br><br>

Children:  If I would… well, obviously, if I would, I would adopt. Do I want kids at this time? Personally no, not at this time. But I’m very happy with my nieces, my nephew. They bring a lot of joy into my life. So it’s not something that I feel, that I need to have kids. No. I’m contempt with who I have right now. 
<br><br>
>>>How old are your nieces and nephew? 
<br><br>
The oldest is 17. 
<br><br>
>>>Is now 17?
<br><br>
Yes.


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
 The first thing I see when I wake up…is my partner…does that answer the question? 
<br><br>
>>>That‘s perfect. (Laughs) 
<br><br>
Yeah. He’s right there. Yeah. And when I go to bed, when I close my eyes, I picture…I allow myself to calm myself down. I imagine, actually. I love running. Both my partner and I love running, and we run a lot by the lake, the lakeshore. And the scenery sometimes is just spectacular. And it’s really something I think of when I close my eyes to calm myself down. Because running for me is...it relaxes me in a way.
<br><br>
>>>Wow!  That’s very cool.  So, relaxation before going to sleep. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Just thinking of an image that calms you down, relaxes you.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
What is the happiest moment in my life…I mean, there’s more than one. Yes.  When I moved to Toronto was a good moment. I mean, terrifying at the same time because, first of all, I didn’t speak English when I came here. But the excitement of wanting to do this, to do something new and not knowing what was going to happen was exciting. So…
<br><br>
>>>All right. Is there a most terrifying moment?
<br><br>
Terrifying moment?  Well again, it is terrifying to going into a new city not speaking the language. That is terrifying.
<br><br>
>>>I see, so, actually the same moment! 
<br><br>
It brings excitement, but it’s terrifying.
<br><br>
>>>Very true. So you’d say probably the same moment for both answers.
<br><br>
It does. It does.

 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
One of my dreams actually was when I was about 15 or 16. I can’t remember exactly, 14 or 15, we came here to visit some family here in Toronto. They live in Brampton.  My dream was actually...I passed by the city, and I said, “Oh my God I want to come back and live here one day.” But not really. It was really just a thought that I put out there. And at 19, I came back!  So that was a dream that I wanted to do. I didn’t know how, but it happened.
<br><br>
>>>So you would tell  you the 17 or 16 year old you that? 
<br><br>
Yeah. “You were crazy, but you did it.” (Leo laughs) Would I do it again?  I probably would, but it was tough the first 5 months because…
<br><br>
>>>Obviously, since you couldn‘t speak English!
<br><br>
Yeah. It was a challenge.
<br><br>
>>>I see. Do you have any dreams now, goals now?
<br><br>
Yeah, well art related -- I want to go further and do different things and keep on expressing myself and just get out there, you know? That is a dream of mine. But part of my dream is what I’m doing right now. So I‘m on the path. 
<br><br>
>>>It’s interesting when I do this with people who are a little bit older, some people are already living their dream.
<br><br>
But there’s always something else.
<br><br>
>>>There’s always something else.
<br><br>
You’ve achieved here, but it never stops.
