    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：22　Years in Toronto： 21.5<br>
     <br> 
      Myles was introduced to me through Steven at the Japanese language exchange at University of Toronto. Myles met me another day for some serious board gaming--something of which I hadn't done in ages and I realized I should do much more often. (Some of the games we found there were awe-inspiring!) Myles just being himself is my definition of Toronto; multiethnic (Barbados x Phillipines), multilingual (English, French, Tagalog, and Japanese), and open to diversity and variety. He also gave a couple of the most memorable answers to the questions (coming from me as I'm writing this, I've done over 60 12Qs). The two that have stuck with me even now is his children (Q.9) which I've quoted his answer many a time now just in regular conversations with people, and his moments (Q.11) which really got me thinking deeply. His answers to the most important thing (Q.7) is really cool too. So Myles, thanks again, and I'll try to meet up with you in a non-capital city in the future!! haha 

</p>

    <br>***</p><br>
    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
  So we're currently at Snakes and Lattes, which is a board game cafe downtown. I chose it because… well on the one hand I did want to meet somewhere middle, since I don't live downtown Toronto. I live in the suburbs in Scarborough. But I think there's just a lot of variety. It's just something fun to do. It was either that or dinner and you can do either one in this area, so, that's why I chose here. </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/myles/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
 $2500? (Thinking) It sounds like a lot, but it's not a lot. <br><br>
>>>Yeah <br><br>
When it comes to plane tickets it's not that much money. <br><br>
>>>Not including plane tickets.  Like one month to live basically. <br><br> 
 Okay, okay. Um… I would just travel. But where is the question and that's the hard part. (Laughs) I do want to go to Japan because I've never been to Japan before but, I also really want to revisit France because I did a home stay there for three months, and I loved it. I didn't want to come home after the three months was up. So I do want to go back, but then there are also other parts of the world that I just want to explore. So it's kind of hard.<br><br>
>>>What part of France were you in? <br><br>
I was in Lyon.  Yeah, so I seem to have this thing, so whenever I go to a country I never go to the capital city. So I've never been to Paris. When I went to the Philippines last month I didn't go to Manila, and I have a feeling if I did go to Japan I wouldn't go to Tokyo, I'd be mostly in Kansai. Because that's where most of my friends are from.<br><br>
>>>So maybe somewhere in the world that's not the capital city.<br><br>
Yeah, somewhere that's not the capital city. I… I think I actually like that though. I tend not to like the bustle of the city, and I think that's just because I grew up in the suburbs. I like it quiet and downtown is not my ideal place to live. But I like being able to come downtown when necessary… But, to get back to the question. If I had to choose right now, it'd probably be Japan because I haven't been there.  
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
  (Thinking)… closest to in any sense?…I don't know. That's a hard one… (Thinking)… I want to say Japan, but, I want to say Japan because I like Japanese culture, and I like a lot of things in Japan and things that come from Japan, but if I think about… I guess, since I've never been there, I guess just stories I've heard and people I've met. The Japanese mentality in general, like of people, doesn't line up very well with my own mentality, so I don't feel close to it in that sense. Um…So that kind of made me want to say France. But even French mentality doesn't line up with mine as much as I'd like. It's really hard for me because I… I think I tend to be a very emotional person and… I like to relate to people who are also emotional people, if that makes any sense. And I haven't really been able to find any other people like that other than in Canada. Mind you I'm not very well-traveled. I've only been to, well I grew up in Canada, been to the Philippines, Barbados, and France, and that's it. (Thinking) I guess if I had to say, closest in mentality and closest in everything that is in proximity basically, would probably be Barbados, because half of my family's from Barbados. So my dad's half of the family is from Barbados, and I've been there twice. And their mentality is actually relatively North American compared to other countries that I've been to, so that would probably be where I would feel closest.

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Thing and place… It's hard for me to choose one place and one thing because what I like about Toronto specifically is there's so much to do and there are so many… well what I like about Toronto is I've met people from all over the world. I've-basically name a country, I've met somebody from there in Toronto. And I think my favorite part about Toronto is, I love eating, and you can have pretty much any type of food that you want in Toronto, and it's often a thing that I do with my Japanese friends if they go home for the summer or something, it's always like, “What do you want to be your last meal? What is something you can't get in Japan that you can get in Toronto?” It always ends up being some kind of ethnic food. Whether it be Ethiopian food or Greek food or Chinese food …I guess you can sort of get. Korean food you can't get very much of in Japan. But yeah there's just a lot of variety in Toronto in general. <br><br>
>>>So that could actually be your thing though.<br><br>
Oh okay, then yes, yes. Variety and multiculturalism could be the things that I choose, yes. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    In a realistic world I wouldn't because I have no artistic ability. So… (laughs) that wouldn't lead anywhere. But I think I would, so I know the Canadian flag is two, two red bars on the side and then white in the middle, and then in the middle of the flag it's a maple leaf. But I feel like that is… I feel that's very detached from the way Canada is now. I think it made a lot of sense back when they designed it because the maple tree's native to Canada, as far as I know anyway. At the very least it's very common in Canada. But I think there's so much more to Canada than just our landscape and I would redesign it to show something more multicultural I think and… I don't know, it would be hard to do, but I would ideally like something that would represent all of the different nations that have immigrated to Canada.
<br><br>
>>>All right. Don't worry, I'll be doing all your promo-ing for you on the site don’t worry haha </p>

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
The ocean… The first thing that pops into my head was the Philippines since I was just there and the hotel that we were staying at, on one side overlooked the ocean. So that was the first thing that came to my head. <br><br>
—The Sun<br>
The sun… I thought of a sunset over an ocean I don't know, it's just cause I was primed for ocean, but yeah, sunset over an ocean. <br><br>
—Death<br>
I pictured evening… Again sunset, but it's just about to turn into night. And then I pictured the grim reaper and a tombstone (laughs). 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
…In general the future scares me. And I don't know if that's just because there are so many dystopian movies out right now that you just kind of have the feeling that everything's going to go terribly. But I think even looking around, I think with just how fast technology's developing, I think it's getting a little bit scary… to look around and see six year old kids on iPads who spend more time with their iPads than with their friends. I think that's a little bit discomforting to me. I don't exactly know what that means for the future. It could just mean that we become a society where we interact more through a screen than we do in person. There are… there are people who would be, “Oh, that detracts from just human interaction in general”. I don't know if I fall into that camp. I think you can interact with a person through a screen. I don't have much of a problem with it. But I think it would just be a very different world. I think technology is going to shape things to be just completely different from what we've seen before. Even going to the Philippines, which is a lot less developed than Canada, it was a bit of an eye-opener to see how… just how different things can be over just a couple of years.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Most important thing in general, in life? Hmmm… (Thinking)… God. I'm Christian, so I think God is the most important thing in my life. <br><br>
>>>Your wrists<br><br>
My wrists, that say God on this hand and love on this hand, so that when I show it to someone else it says God Loves, but when I read it it says Love God as a reminder to myself. <br><br>
>>>Wow. I don't think we need to get much more in depth. 
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Romantic partner?<br><br>
>>> Yeah. Sometimes people ask "Is that for a job?"" haha <br><br>
 Partner in crime? (laughs) Um… Okay, for sure honesty. I think lying is probably my most hated trait in anybody and I don't even care if it's just a little lie. It just bothers me… and I think vulnerability. I think if you're going to be with somebody, you need to be able to tell them anything, really. I don't like having… I don't like having barriers. I feel like the other person should be able to trust you with whatever information they are giving you and you should be able to trust them with whatever information you give them. And you should be able to mutually support each other through that. 

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/myles/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yes<br>
Children: Yes<br><br> 
 So in an ideal world, I would like to be independently rich so that what we can do whatever we want (laughs). But I think first of all,and something that's really important and dear to me is that my children would be multilingual. And I think, I don't know if that's a product of doing an undergrad in linguistics or just being surrounded by different languages my whole life. But I think, I think one of the most interesting facts that I learned in linguistics is that monolingualism is actually very rare in the world. It's limited to a very small set of countries and the majority of countries in the world have inhabitants that speak two, three, four languages on a daily basis. And so I'd like my children to be able to do the same. I don't know if I have the ability to be able to teach my children that many languages, but I would like to. And then with that, I would like to travel around the world with them. I don't think it really matters where we go, I'd just like them to experience what life is like in other places, because I do think we are very pampered in Canada and we're very oblivious to how pampered we are until we go somewhere else and see how they live. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Hmmm… (Thinking)… I think the first thing I would want to see when I wake up is the sun, because I don’t… okay, so I hate the cold. And I associate darkness with coldness, so I would want to see the sun because I would immediately associate that with warmth. And I'd most likely associate it with summer as well, which is probably my favorite season. And… what I wanna see when I go to bed? (Thinking)…I think I’d… this is going to sound weird, but I think I would like to see someone smile. I like seeing people smile and it's just… it would make going to bed a lot easier knowing that at least one person is happy. I like it when anybody smiles, really. <br><br>
>>>It doesn't have to be your significant other?<br><br>
No, it doesn't have to be my significant other. It could be a best friend, family member. But yeah, smile would give me some peace when I sleep at night.

<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
(Thinking)… This is hard. I don't know if I can pick the happiest moment of my life. I don't think I have one. I'm pretty much happy anytime I'm with my friends. I like spending time with people, I like spending time with friends. I like, I don't like crowds so, I prefer one or two, three, four people max when I'm hanging out with people, but that is actually my ideal hang-out time. That's what I, that's probably what I enjoy the most in life and I will usually put that before anything really, including schoolwork, which is really bad. But, yeah, I think my friends are probably one of the things I cherish the most in my life so anything to do with them will just make me happy. <br><br>
The most terrifying moments of my life? I think <i>I</i> scare myself the most out of anything in life. And what scares me the most is how… volatile I can be at times, because there are… there are days when I just don't want anything to do with life at all. And I've been at points where I've just considered suicide and I've just considered ending it. But that would be after having a great day, and I think that's what scares me because I feel like a ticking time bomb that could go off at any moment I just don't know when. Um…but yeah, I think that's what's scary. <br><br>
 >>>Wow, that is an incredible answer. 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
 So I had a lot of childhood dreams. I wanted to be a lawyer originally and that was at the suggestion of my mom because I would always argue with her and I would always win the arguments. And she was just like, “you should be a lawyer because you like arguing, and you're pretty good at it”. But, yeah I know nothing about law at this point. And so (laughs), and actually on that same note, I would probably go back and tell my younger self “most arguments aren't worth it”. You need to learn when to stand down and just say okay and move on with life. It's not… it's not worth it most of the time. At another point I wanted to be a doctor, but then I realized I didn't really like blood. I'm not afraid of blood I just don’t—I don't like sick people, which is really weird. I'm always afraid I will do something that will kill them, so… I don't like that kind of setting, so I decided not to be a doctor. And then for awhile I wanted to be a musician and then, i was like there's no money in that, so I didn't do that either. And then for awhile I was lost. <br><br>
But right now I'm heading for speech language pathology. That is my current dream, which is kind of weird because it's very similar to a doctor and I am working with sick patients all the time. Or at least I'm volunteering right now with sick patients all the time. But yeah, that is my current goal, that is what I'm working towards. I don't really… I'm not the type of person to plan very far ahead, so that is my current goal. I've already applied, so I'm just waiting for a result.
