    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：37　Years in Toronto： 20 <br>

      Sandy I met at Han and Bernard’s party. My first impression of Sandy was “Holy…this man is BUILT!!!” It turned out Sandy was actually on Canada’s national dragon boat team, and he had just come to the party after practice. It explains why he was equal in presence to the Greek God he is posing next to in his banner pic haha. I even included a picture I took with Sandy to prove this!! (pic.5) What’s incredible about Sandy is his mind is just as loaded as his body!! It was a lot of fun talking with him about a variety of topics, and it really got me thinking when I heard stories about the things he experienced growing up, and through daily life. You can check out a lot of this in his questions, and if I were to choose a few, they would be the closeness (Q.2), the future (Q.6), the moments (Q.11), and the dreams (Q.12). So Sandy, thanks for everything, and I know you’ve been to Japan before but you should come again! Maybe for dragon boat (does Japan even have a team? haha).

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
 So we’re in Greektown in a restaurant called Astoria. And it’s pretty much in the heart of Greektown. We chose this because it was convenient. It’s very close to where I live. And chose this food that Leo gets to experience.

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
At this moment in time, I would say I would like to visit Dubai. I grew up there and things have changed since I came to Canada. It’s not the Dubai that I know it to be. So probably revisiting my childhood place where I grew up and exploring the area. I’m not too sure if $2,500 will cut it for a month in that city but I’d probably try to fund it a little bit myself as well.
<br><br>
>>>How long were you in Dubai?
<br><br>
I was there for about seven years. Yes. It was pretty much the “wonder years.” When I was growing up, since I was about five. So those experiences have lasted with me this long, and I never had an opportunity to go back and take a look at the city.
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
(Thinking)…I guess I almost answered that with my first question. I would say I was very closely associated with Dubai. More so than Sri Lanka as well.  I am Sri Lankan but I think most of my childhood memories and what I remember and what I cherish more are my experiences in Dubai and that’s why I associate myself with Dubai. The United Arab Emirates. 
<br><br>
>>>Did you have a specific experience in Dubai that you cherish?
<br><br>
I think the schools, which they have this really good system that I went to. It was just free. It’s a city that you don’t have much to worry about as a kid. As an adult, I think there are other issues but as a kid, it felt safe. Innocent environment when I was there. 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah because I think most people probably reading this or watching this have no notion of what Dubai in the 80’s was like. (laughs) And so that’s why I asked that.
<br><br>
Right. And it was a very innocent city and innocent time for a lot of kids growing up. I can’t say much about the adults. I was too young to comprehend the situation. 

</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/sandy/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
Thing? I think the thing that would represent Toronto would be CN Tower. It’s…I would say it’s what a lot of people who have grown up here have known Toronto to be about. It’s one of the few things that I can take people to. There isn’t much else I find that really stands out. We have a beautiful culture and beautiful sub-city. But something that stands out would be the Tower.
<br><br>
A place in Toronto? Hm… That’s a hard one. There are quite a few suburbs of Toronto. I mean, quite a few districts of Toronto I would say…There’s Little India, Greektown. Cabbage Town and quite a few other districts. There are some people who would say Kensington Market is a pretty cool area to be in. So that’s a bit trickier. Not too sure if I can answer that quite well -
<br><br>
>>>No no! You’ve answered it already!
<br><br>
Yeah the districts. There are many, yeah. There are many. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    No, I wouldn’t change a thing. I like the flag the way it is and I think it was picked for a reason. Changing it now would…hmm. I’d say I wouldn’t change it because I do not have a clear understanding of why the flag currently is how it is and why it was chosen. It would be almost ignorant of me to change it without knowing the full ramifications and the reason why these things were chosen, so I wouldn’t change it.

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
When I bring up the ocean, I actually don’t think of just the water. I think of a beach. That’s something that in Toronto, you don’t get much of. So to me, it’s more of a…I see a beach. I see freedom and I see relaxation.
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Summer. I mean, that’s the impression I get. In the winter, there is a lot of sun but you don’t get to quite experience it because you get into work before the sun comes out. And you’re back home once it’s down. Summer is pretty much when time changes to help you observe the sun a little bit more.
<br><br>
>>>That’s a very Toronto-like answer.
<br><br>
—Death<br>
Death. The first image that came up in my head was a skeleton. So I mean, I think death is just a part of nature. 

 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
Okay. I find that if I were to assess future of the average Canadian, I feel like they’re going to be poorer. I feel that they’re not that... In 20 years, the people who are 37 years old would likely be able to afford less. And that has to do with the cost of living rising and a whole bunch of other issues but it’s just that we’ve taken for granted the…. (thinking) How do I put this? We take it for granted how far we’ve progressed compared to third-world nations, and the reason why we are able to afford certain things is because there are third-world nations. That third-world nations are willing to be paid less to produce stuff that we consume. As soon as these third-world countries start coming out of that situation, where their cost of living rises, their lifestyle improves, then we’re not going to have the opportunity to get things from those countries for the price that we were paying. It’s gonna come to a point where I find Canadians, North Americans, are going to find life not as comfortable. That’s just because of economics itself. 
<br><br>
Then you talk about the environment. I see that there’s a push to get the environment on the “good side.” Or to get on the environment’s “good side.” But I think that… (thinking)… I think the salvation is more like some sort of innovation versus what we seem to be attempting now, which is conservation. Conservation doesn’t seem to be working as fast as we need it to. So the only way the environment can get better, I find, is if somebody comes up with some amazing idea that would sort of fix it.
<br><br>
Having said that, I like to have an optimistic view of what the future holds. So I was just referring to the next 50 years but I’m always a person that’s always been into exploring the stars. Love to look. I love to see the Sci-Fi aspect of it. And that’s something I’d love humanity to get towards. But the next 50 years are gonna be quite trying, I think.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Freedom. My ability to do what I want when I want to. And that means being financially free to do that. Sometimes even responsibility-free. And I can understand that there are certain things that I have responsibility towards and I get that. But…and I think I still negotiate those quite well and I wouldn’t change my…yeah, I wouldn’t like to lose my freedom.</p>
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
I actually don’t know. And this is quite interesting because I try not to fixate myself on what I’m looking for. Probably explains why I’m single, but I think almost every person out there has something interesting about them. Something that I don’t know about, that intrigues me. So I wouldn’t want to go with the cliché: smart, funny, et cetera, et cetera. I think everybody can be [that] in their own sense. So what I look for in a partner is tricky. I don’t know what it is until I meet them, generally.

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/sandy/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Even with that, I’d say I don’t know. I’ve been told if you meet the right person, you will want to get married. So I’m not gonna say “No, I’m not gonna get married.” But it’s not a goal. It’s not expected. 
<br><br>
Children: No, I don’t. And maybe it’s just because I’ve never been hit by the child bug to want to have a family and what not.  I think it’s also connected to this idea of freedom. 
<br><br>
>>>Very much connected to that idea. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
So when I wake up, the one thing that I want to be is relaxed. That has a deeper impact than just a word. To be relaxed, it just simply means that you have no worries. You’ve dealt with all your issues the previous night. You have no concerns ahead of you other than your day to day ritual but there’s nothing that’s in the back of your mind that’s gonna be building up into anxiety. And similarly, that’s the thing that’ll help me sleep. So going to bed, what I want, is that clarity that I’ve dealt with all the issues that are gonna pop up and there’s not gonna be a bad surprise in the future. So I think going to bed relaxed, waking up relaxed, is probably the key thing for me. 
<br><br>
>>>There’s no really one thing? 
<br><br>
There’s isn’t. For me, it’s that feeling. The feeling of being relaxed. The state of being relaxed and that’s connected to quite a lot of things. It’s hard to achieve. There’s always gonna be something. Maybe work, people you’re around. Just the weather. It’s tricky.

</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Hmm… I’d say one of the most happiest moments probably go back to a Christmas that I had and this is me being a kid. That it really is the happiness in getting stuff and getting toys. So it’s a very superficial sense but it still rings strong in my mind. There was a Christmas and I think it was 1986 perhaps where my parents basically wanted to give us the Christmas of our life. And they spent as much as they could. We were very poor but they tried to provide us with this experience that a kid should experience once in their life. One Christmas where “oh my goodness, there’s chocolate after chocolate. There’s toys after toys.”  And they’re small toys but as a kid, you don’t understand value. You don’t understand quality. You understand quantity more than anything else. And me and my brother, we had a great time that year. 
<br><br>
But I think it’s also if you look back at reflection, it was one of the few times that our family was together as well, at that time. So the reason I’m bringing that up is because in hindsight, I recognize it as a closer family that I had. So I hope that explains a little bit of that question. 
<br><br>
The second half was the terrifying side. That is tricky. I don’t… it’s interesting because it’s hard for me to recollect the most the terrifying thing. I can have a terrifying experience just driving and getting stopped by a cop because I was speeding. That itself just gets my heart pounding. But it’s not a worthy experience, I’d say. It does get me terrified but I won’t give it the time of day. So I would say…(thinking) There was such an anxiety when I came to this country. We took refuge in Canada and there’s a time when we didn’t know if our application would be accepted or not. Canada was gonna be the place where we made our home as a family. So…terrifying, anxious, yes. That was the “make or break” decision of where my life was gonna end up. And they said yes. Canada said yes and I made a great life out of it. But if they had said no, my life could have been somewhere else altogether. 
<br><br>
>>>Wow. That is a big moment of your life.
<br><br>
That is the making or breaking of my life. Yep.


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
Hmm…(thinking)…my childhood dream was actually very simple, I’d say. I wanted to be a pilot. And I still love flying. I haven’t actually got a pilot license but I plan on taking lessons anyway. 
<br><br>
>>>Have you flown before?
<br><br>
I’ve never flown before. I’ve taken classes. I’ve gone to school and such but I’ve never really flown. So it is on my checklist as one of the “to do’s” to get in the air and be able to fly. So I’m pretty close to one of my childhood dreams. It was. Other than being a superhero and whatnot. And we always dream of those things but when it comes to realistic dreams, that was it. What would I tell my childhood self about my goal? 
<br><br>
>>>What would you say, tell him today, regarding that?
<br><br>
It’ll happen.  (Leo laughs)   It’ll happen. Just do what you’re doing.
<br><br>
>>>Any dreams or goals now?? 
<br><br>
It’s funny you say that. I don’t quite have a short term or long term goal anymore. I used to. I had them. I seem to have got to them. And now, I’m trying to enjoy the moment of it. So it used to be a fight to get to where I was. Studying, I did a lot of schooling. The initial sort of work, but my goals aren’t…I guess they aren’t too lofty. And it’s about really enjoying a little bit of what we have here.
<br><br>
>>>All right. Thank you very much.
<br><br>
No problem….actually, I could have said some other short term goals. Like paddling at world championships and such. Does that help? 
<br><br>
>>>Yeah! 
<br><br>
So a short term goal I have right now which is coming to fruition in August [2015] would be that we’re paddling at the Dragon Boat World Championships in Niagara Falls this summer. So dragon boating has been a consistent, constant short term goal from year to year. So, that’s it.
