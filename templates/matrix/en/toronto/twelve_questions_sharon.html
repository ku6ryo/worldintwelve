    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：22　Years in Toronto： 22<br>
     <br> 
 Sharon was introduced to me through both Steven and Myles. Sharon gave me a tour of Hart house, one of the buildings in University of Toronto, which was filled with interesting student art, and interesting looking students running out of the gymnasium wearing tank tops (even though it was approximately -20 degrees Celsius outside). Sharon with her great sense of humour was great fun to talk to, and even made me realize (through her own confession) that she looks eerily similar to one AKB48 member. If you know AKB48, you’ll probably know which one; if you don’t…well I guess google was probably invented for these purposes lol. And of course with her sense of humour came great answers, with my recommendations being the representatives (Q.3), the flag (Q.4), children (Q.9) and wake up/go to sleep (Q.10). So thanks again Sharon, maybe we can go to see a concert together in Akihabara!! Hint hint ;)

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
 Where is - Oh! This is Hart House. I chose it because it just seems like a good place for an interview. I went to University of Toronto. This is… this building is part of University of Toronto. Yeah. There’re so many aspects of it. There's the Athletic Center, there's the Photo Club, there's the theater. It seemed to represent Toronto, I think. It's very diverse. 
   </p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
  I'd probably go to Hong Kong. Actually, my family's from Hong Kong. My parents were born there. And my family… most of my family on both sides is still there. And… yeah I'd probably go stay with my grandma and just spoil her. 
<br><br>
>>>You'd spoil her? 
<br><br>
I would spoil her.  (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Not you being the spoiled one. 
<br><br>
I think she would try to. But then using the money, I would probably spoil her. And spend a lot of time with her. 
<br><br>
>>>What part of Hong Kong does she live in? 
<br><br>
Oh my God…. I don't actually remember the name. That's how much I haven't been there. Yeah. She lives on a mountain somewhere. 
<br><br>
>>>Oh. By the mountains?
<br><br>
Yeah, it's by the mountains. (laughs)


 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
 It's actually Japan.  Yeah. I think the past two years, I've actually met a lot of people who are from Japan. They come here for working holiday. Or… they study here. And in the past three years, I think I've gone three times. Including like an exchange there for two months. And so, I've met a lot of people. And I feel like every time I go, more of me gets left behind. And it's actually really scary. Because I feel like now I have two places that I could potentially call home, especially in the future. And yeah, I have my Tokyo humans and my Toronto humans, as I call them.

</p>

<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
I think the thing would be Trail Mix. (laughs). It's not very original. But going back to the diversity, I think. A lot of different tastes, I guess. And I think there's also a lot of… potential in Toronto. Potential for it to become some like big city globally, in the world. And also potential for the people who come here. I think people come here, like I know my boyfriend, people I know have come here because they want to experience diversity, but within one area. So I think it's good to get a taste of things. IE Trail Mix. Place is a bit harder… I'd say University of Toronto. Just because it seems like a lot of people come here to study, both Canadian and not Canadian. So, it's a really good place to represent it. 


    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
     As of right now, I’d just make it like white. (laughs)
<br><br>
>>>Like blank?
<br><br>
Yeah, just blank. Like a white sheet. Yeah… I think mostly because I'm really cold right now. But also, (laughs) back to the whole potential thing. Yeah it's like a blank slate. Yeah. 

 </p>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Sad. 
<br><br>
>>>Sad. 
<br><br>
Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>Is that it? 
<br><br>
Sad, yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>Okay. 
<br><br>
—The Sun<br>
Omnipotence.
<br><br>

—Death <br>
 …Powerful. 
<br><br>
>>>Want to explain any of them or is that just good enough? 
 <br><br>
(Thinking) No…I actually I… this is a bit personal. But recently someone I knew… someone I knew committed suicide. So I think… well I wasn't very close to him. But it just seemed the way it affected everyone around me. And seeing the way it affected people that actually were close to me. And thinking about ways death could affect me. Or people closer to me, it was really powerful. Affecting. 
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
 I don't know. I think mostly, everyone is in control with their own future. And I think, everyone's future is intertwined. So if everyone is in control of their own future, I think it's just up to us to make it what we want it to be. I'm really positive in that way. Like, if you don't like it you can change it. It's never impossible.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
What is the most important thing for me? (laughs). I'm actually a Christian. So… God is really important to me. My faith, yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>Your parents are Christian?
<br><br>
My parents are Christian, yeah. I grew up in Church. 


 </p>
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
 I do have a boyfriend. (laughs). I think someone who… is independent. Because I'm also very independent. And I think I like it when we can both lead our own lives. And be there for the other person. But… have them be able to take care of themselves as well. There are times when we don't see each other ever. And if we're both okay with that, then that's really good. 
<br><br>
>>>How long is “ever”?
<br><br>
Like, once in a month. Yeah… It's okay, I think. (laughs)

  </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/sharon/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: Yes.<br>
Children:  Yes. 
<br><br>

Well, I'm in my Masters of Teaching. So I've been learning a lot about Child Psychology. And actually, I think it's been really…really just encouraged to nurture my child however they want to grow up. So, not so much impose my interest onto them. But really, pay attention, and be mindful of what they want to become. And I think that's what my parents did for me. And that really helped me to hone my talents and encourage my creativity. And I think I really… I really respect my parents. And so I really want to emulate their parenting style. Which is rare, maybe. Some people don't want to be like their parents at all. But I'm the complete opposite. 
<br><br>
>>>Is there anything that you learned, say, going through your education now that you wouldn't have known, that you want to employ if you're gonna raise a child?
<br><br>
Hmmm…I don't know. I realize a lot of teaching is… it aligns with my instinct. Like going into my Masters and sitting down in a classroom and hearing these lectures, it just sort of reaffirms what I instinctively wanted to do with my children. So it was interesting in that way. I haven't learned anything new, nothing has really been challenged.
<br><br>
>>>Challenged?
<br><br>
Yeah. Challenged. Not yet anyway. 


</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
An experience?  Oh my God. That's so hard! I know. Sunlight. I think even before I close my eyes, I like napping during the day. (laughs). But… and I hate it when I wake up and it's dark. I think that's the worst feeling. And it ruins the better half of my morning. So… sunlight. 
<br><br>
>>>For both? 
<br><br>
For both. Sunlight. 


 </p>

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/sharon/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
The happiest was probably when I found out I get accepted to JET and my Masters. I think I was happy not just because of the accomplishment. But mostly, it sort of showed me that if I actually work hard at something, then it can be achieved. Sort of rewarding my hard work. Which is really… a good experience for me. Terrifying is more physical, I think. I was in a really bad car accident when I was 11, I think. And that has really shaped how I drive. People say I drive like a 90 year old woman. Like, I go like this. And I'm always made fun of, Myles, everyone, like “what are you doing?.” It's rooted in something deeper. Yeah. 



 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
 My childhood dream was to become an author. It's been that way since I was like… for as long as I can remember. I was always very big on creative writing. And that's kind of why I became an English major, in undergrad. And I think now… my dream is more to become just as creative as I possibly can. Like, learn as many instruments as I can, make as many things, do as many creative things as possible. Just to keep my creative juices flowing. And so if I were to speak to child Sharon, I'd just say ""keep going"". Because I feel like it's just been a journey that has led me up to where I am now. So, I don't think I've made any mistakes. Maybe that's just me being arrogant (Everyone laughs). Like, “I’m perfect! I've never made any mistakes!” No, I'm joking. 
<br><br>
>>>You don't have to be arrogant to feel good. 
<br><br>
Yeah. 
<br><br>
>>>But yeah…perfection. Just perfection after perfection after perfection! (Everyone laughs) 
<br><br>
And here we are, being interviewed!! (laughs)
