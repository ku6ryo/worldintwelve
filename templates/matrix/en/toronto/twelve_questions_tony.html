    <p><u>Profile and Leo's Take</u><br>
    Age：23　Years in Toronto： 5<br>
     <br> 
      Tony was introduced to me by Jesse. OK here is the thing. When I met Tony, I could tell there was this “athlete” aspect to him. It was February in Toronto, so yes he was covered and bundled in cold-weather clothing, but you could just tell the man was fit. After I talked with him, I found out he was a NBA fan (Yay!!) of the Lakers (Not so yay...) and he himself was a baller. Then he showed me the clip of him dunking...not “I used to be able to dunk a volleyball” dunking, not just “lay it in from above the rim and touch it” dunking, an actual, powerful, <a target="_blank" href="http://makeagif.com/lBmRGm"> two-handed slam</a>. I started calling him Sensei after that. According to Sensei, he only started dunking recently, after going through a proper training and work-out program. Sensei was giving me (and all of you others who still believe you can dunk one day) hope! HOPE!! Oh sensei, please lead us to the dunking promised land…
<br><br>
Anyway, the questions. Being born in China, and spending a majority of his life in the US, it was interesting hearing Tony talk about how he was brought up, and his views on all three countries (including Canada). Tony is the successful example of what a lot of people come to the US and Canada hope for, the goal to provide a better future for your children, so hearing first hand examples was a real thought provoking experience. I recommend the close place (Q.2), children (Q.9), moments (Q.11), and dreams (Q.12). So Tony, as you stated, come to Japan one day and dunk on those rims there!! And please, sensei, please help us...haha

    <p><u>Place for shooting and reason</u>
    <br>
  This is the Robart’s Library, which is pretty much smack down in the middle of U of T. I picked this place because it's representative of the university. The reason I came to Toronto was actually for the school. I spent a lot of my time here studying, hanging out with friends. So, yeah.  That's why I thought this was a fitting place. 
 </p>

    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/tony/1.jpg"></p>

    <p><em>Q1</em><br>
    If you were handed US$2500 and received a one month vacation where you could live in one city, anywhere in the world, where would you choose? What would you do? </p>
    <p><em>A1</em><br>
$2,500? I probably...I always wanted to go to Japan. Yeah, because I took a Japanese language course and it was really fun. It opened my eyes to a lot of different things. Pretty much every single one of my friends has been to Japan, except for me. Actually, one of my friends, one of my classmates from the same language class - he's going to graduate and then he's going to go on a trip in May. So, if I had that money I would probably go with him. If I still had money leftover I would probably go visit my friend in New York. 
 
 </p>
<br>
<p><em>Q2</em><br>
    What country do you feel “close” to, other than your own?</p>
    <p><em>A2</em><br>
Yeah. Well, I guess the USA, because I pretty much grew up there. I spent my formative years there, and a lot of my really good friends are from the US. And family is in the United States. Yeah, I had a good time there.
<br><br>
>>>You went to high school there?
<br><br>
Yep. 
<br><br>
>>>See, that makes sense. It's easier than say, China, where you were born. 
<br><br>
Yeah. Actually, I don't feel...I mean, when I first left China and I lived in Canada, I thought that was where my homeland is and I should feel some sort of affinity to it. So, nine years pass, I graduate high school, I go back to China. Obviously, at that time all I had was some relatives. There was nothing else there. After that, for the longest amount of time, I felt like a foreigner. Wherever I went in China I felt like a foreigner. When I came back here, I just had this realization that I don't feel anything for the culture of my birth.
<br><br>
>>>That's interesting.
<br><br>
I think it depends on the people that are close to you, where they are. 
</p>
<br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/tony/2.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p><em>Q3</em><br>
    What one "thing" and "place" best represents your city?</p>
    <p><em>A3</em><br>
[Thinking]… What thing would be the thing…? I think that's the CN Tower. If you move the CN Tower, it wouldn't be Toronto. That's what I think. That's a thing. And place? Well, a place for me would be the university. Other people might say otherwise, but for me the university represents Toronto, because that's where I spent a lot of my time...studying, as a student. 
 
    <p>
    <br>
    <em>Q4</em><br>
    If you were to redsign your country's flag, how would you do it?</p>
    <p><em>A4</em><br>
    I probably wouldn't want to touch it because it's...I don't know. I've seen people try to redesign it, but...
<br><br>
>>>You've seen people try to redesign it?? 
<br><br>
Yeah, and I've also seen the original designs for the competition that was held to redesign the flag. It's pretty hard, I don’t know, it has to be hard redesigning something that's so iconic. Off the top of my head, I don't know. I'll replace the maple leaf with the Toronto Raptors logo [laughing].
<br><br>
>>>So one team represents the entire country! 
<br><br>
I'd have to say that's pretty true.
<br><br>
>>>In terms of basketball?
<br><br>
In terms of basketball, yeah.
<br><br>
>>>Hockey, not so much.
<br><br>
Well, maybe a hockey puck, I don't know. Maybe change the maple leaf to a beaver. Yeah, I don't know. (laughs)

<br>

<p><em>Q5</em><br>
    Please tell me the images you have for the following words. </p>
    <p><em>A5</em><br>
—The Ocean<br>
Highway One, all along the California Coast. Yeah, I actually went on a road trip last summer. That was my first time seeing the Pacific Ocean, actually. It was pretty awesome. We just took the long route and we drove along the Coast. Yeah, that's Highway One. 
<br><br>

—The Sun. <br>
A G-Class Star. Because I took this class called Stars and Galaxies last year. In the curriculum we went over stars, and I remember this one was a G-Class Star. 
<br><br>
>>>As opposed to? What's a different class? How many classes are there?
<br><br>
I can't remember, but there are a lot of classes. The G-Class is like...I think it's an average star. O-Class is the super hot, bright, super giants. So, yeah, G-Class star.
<br><br>

—Death <br>
Hmmm…(thinking)…failure. Failure. Like a huge failure in life. That's like death to me.
<br><br>
>>> Does that mean when you die you fail? Or…??
<br><br>
I don't know, I guess…(thinking)…I'm not afraid of death. At this stage in my life. But I feel like if you fail like really bad in life that's almost as bad as dying.
 
 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q6</em><br>
   How do you feel about the future? Both yourself and mankind.</p>
    <p><em>A6</em><br>
For myself, I guess you don't know what's going to happen, but  from what I've experienced in life, as long as you keep at it, doing whatever you want to do, then your future just falls in place. For mankind, I think the future is pretty bright. Right now, relatively, we're at the most peaceful period. And with the internet and everything, everyone is super connected, and information flows pretty free. People are experiencing so many things through whatever devices, from all over the world. Yeah, I think the future is pretty bright for mankind.

<br>
<p><em>Q7</em><br>
   What's the most important "thing" for you?</p>
    <p><em>A7</em><br>
Most important thing? I guess, the most important thing is to be happy. 
<br><br>
>>>Happiness?
<br><br>
Happiness, and by happiness I mean pursuing your goals in life. Whatever you want to do, do it right, do it good, and be happy. </p>
    <br><br>

<p><em>Q8</em><br>
 What do you look for in a partner?</p>
  <p><em>A8</em><br>
Um…It probably would someone with a good head on her shoulders. Intelligence is pretty important. Sense of humor. Someone that you're friends with before having a relationship, so you get to know each other pretty well. Someone who you can spend time with doing nothing and still have some fun. Someone who's chill. …A sense of humor is pretty important, yeah. Yeah, and then, pretty eyes. (laughs)

<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/tony/5.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q9</em><br>
   Do you want to get married? Do you want children? What do you want to do with them? How do you want them to grow up? </p>
    <p><em>A9</em><br>
Marriage: I guess, in the distant future I would. Yeah, I guess. <br>
Children:  Yeah, I think I would like it. 
<br><br>
[Original Question]<br>
I don't think that I would be helicopter-parenting them, because kids… they're also human beings too. They’re unique human beings with their own thoughts or whatever. I think children they don’t come from you, they come through you. You are the vessel that kind of brings them into existence. I would show them stuff, like I like basketball, I like sports. I would show them this is basketball, this is tennis, you can play them. I'm not going to force them to do anything, just guide them, and hopefully they make the right choices. It doesn't just take two people to raise kids, it takes a lot of people, and kids, they…they’re influenced by a lot of things. I guess that's how I would approach the situation. 



</p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q10</em><br>
What would be the ideal thing to see the first moment you wake up? What would be the ideal thing to see the moment before you fall asleep?</p>
  <p><em>A10</em><br>
Ideal thing - a beautiful day, a sunny day. If I see that, that's pretty good in Toronto, in the winter time [laughs]. Everyday, when I was a student, I'd wake up and I’d see darkness.  But, yeah, a beautiful day.
<br><br>
>>> What would be the ideal thing before you go to sleep?
<br><br>
 A clock that says 12:00 AM. I don't want to go to sleep and see things like 6:00 AM or 5:00 AM.
<br><br>
>>>So, a clock that says a reasonable hour. 
<br><br>
A reasonable hour, so I know I'm getting enough sleep.
<br><br>
>>>I guess you have a pretty hectic lifestyle. 
<br><br>
I wouldn't say hectic. I tell myself to go to bed earlier but it doesn’t happen…
<br><br>
>>>I understand, I'm in the same boat you are right now. 
 </p>
 <br>
<p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_questions/tony/6.jpg">
</p>
<br>
<p><em>Q11</em><br>
   What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the most terrifying moment in your life? </p>
    <p><em>A11</em><br>
Happiest moment? I have two happiest moments.
<br><br>
>>>Yeah?
<br><br>
That's okay?
<br><br>
>>>Great, yeah.
<br><br>
My first happiest moment was graduation from university. My parents came, my brother was here, a lot of my friends came. It was just a good, all five years of school. It was a good celebratory situation. My mom was really happy. When I saw her being really happy…she worked really hard when I was a kid and my brother was a kid. Our family went through a lot stuff in the past. She worked really hard to get us from where she came from to where we are right now. When I saw that I was really happy. The second happy moment was during my road trip. I got to drive in the desert in Nevada. Then, those red mountains, yeah I got do drive through that. That's like a childhood dream of mine and also to stay there at night and look at the Milky Way. So, yeah. Those two.
<br><br>
>>>What were your most frightening?
<br><br>
Most frightening moment? (Thinking)… Probably when I was a kid, when I was about 13 years old. My dad couldn't find a job… like he wasn't home at all. I found out  later that he was out trying to get certificates. . He graduated with a PhD but he couldn’t get a job. My mom was working three different jobs. My brother was delinquent at the time.
<br><br>
>>>Older brother?
<br><br>
Yeah, he's older than me by about six years. I was 13 and…I guess I was at that age where you understand what's happening with the family, that a lot of bad shit's happening, but you can't really do anything about it. Right?
<br><br>
>>>Yeah. You’re 13. 
<br><br>
Because I was 13. I was trying to do something about it but I couldn’t. It was this powerless feeling, like you know you're a kid and you can't control anything. You have no idea what's going to happen, where your life is going to lead. That was probably the most terrifying moment. 


 </p>
    <br>
<p><em>Q12</em><br>
What was your childhood dream? What would you say to the childhood you, now? And what is your dream now? </p>
  <p><em>A12</em><br>
My childhood dream was to play in the NBA. (laughs) My brother was this freakish athlete. 
<br><br>
>>> Oh really? 
<br><br>
Yeah, But, I had this dream of playing in the...every kid had a dream of playing NBA basketball. Yeah and then, my family was pretty poor. I didn’t have the resources. Yeah…and I guess my physical attributes developed late. What would I tell that kid? I would tell him to focus on playing basketball and get your dad to take to take you to camps, and practice your ball handling because you're going to be tall enough when you get older.
<br><br>
>>>You could be become a point guard. As long as you have the ball handling and shooting skills! 
<br><br>
Yeah, exactly. I think I have the athletic ability...I can dunk, so I think I had the potential, maybe not to be in the NBA, but to be good. To be better, I guess.
<br><br>
>>>What's your dream now?
<br><br>
My dream now is to work hard, work hard with my startup, help it get the necessary, a good funding round so we can get a lot of income, and become bigger. Then write my mom a check and pay off the mortgage, because she did so much for us. Even now, she does so much. So that's my dream.
<br><br>
>>>What a great kid. (laughs)
<br><br>
I don't know man (laughs). Thanks!
