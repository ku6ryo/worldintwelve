  <div class="title">12 Stops × 12 Animals</div>
  <div class="block image-center">
    <p><em>Overview</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This is a sub-project where one quantity of 12 is crossed with another quantity of 12 to create representation of that city. In this one, I choose a park I want to visit, get on a train or a bus, go 12 stops, get off, and walk to the rest of the way. While walking, I take photographs of the first 12 animals I see. Hence: "12 Stops × 12 Animals"	</p>
    <br><br>
    <p><em>Route</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>So for Toronto, I started at St. Clair Station which was the closes stop to where I was living, and went 12 stops from there to St. Patrick Station.

    <br>
    <p>My final destination was Queen's Park in University of Toronto, but fearin there wouldn't be too many animals on a weekday in February, I decided to go to Grange Park too. </p>

    <br>
    <p>After getting out of the station, I went past OCAD and to the park.</p>

    <p><em>The Animals!</em></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The first animal I saw was a squirrel climbing a tree.</p>

    <p>A few people walking their dogs,</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/a2.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>or letting their dogs walk themselves.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/a3.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I didn't see anymore animals in Grange Park, so I headed towards Queen's park. I saw all those cool old buildings that are on the U of T campus along the way.  </p>
    <br>

     <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/scape6.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>As I arrived, I noticed something...alarming.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/scape7.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p><em>WHERE ARE ALL THE ANIMALS?????</em></p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/scape8.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p><em>NO, NOT YOU, SNOWMAN!! ANIMALS!!!</em></p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/scape9.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>I felt devastated. There wasn't a single non-human in the entire park. As I headed home, I saw one dog, but seriously, too little too late. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="photo"><img class="landscape" src="/images/matrix/toronto/twelve_twelve/animals/a4.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <p>But guess what? I sort of had a feeling this would happen. That's why I stocked up on animals shots as I was going on in my daily life!! Yep, I'm prepared!!! Ok, here we go. The Canada Goose man and his dog. </p>

    <p>I saw a lot of bigger dogs in Toronto. Because its cold?? I don't know.</p>

　　<p><em>Afterthoughts</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>So I couldn't find 12 animals in my initial journey, but I believe things ended up pretty good. One intereseting thing I found were dog parks. You see them in New York too, a little, but its basically proof that there is limited space for dogs to run around in major metropoli. </p>

    <br><br>
    <p><em>Last Words</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>The biggest "What the...??" moments in Toronto regarding animals were all the dogs and their socks/shoes. It makes sense, since they are walking on snow all day and their feet do get pretty dirty. At least that's what I think they are for. Also I just thought there wer eprobably less animals to see in general because of the season I went, and that the summer would be quite different. Lake Ontario is probably an interesting spot to check out. </p>
