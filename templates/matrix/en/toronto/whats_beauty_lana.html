    <p><em>Q1：What is "beauty" to you? </em><br>
         A："Something to accept in its natural form"<br>
         →Beauty is an incredibly terrifying thing. Too little of it and (as far as research tells us) substandard social subjection will be your fate. Too much of it and... Well, the plights of beauty garner little to no sympathy. Beauty can deteriorate with time, shame you and warp your mental and physical well-being. Solution: beauty seeds happiness when the ego is removed. Let beauty come to you in its most natural form - for me, my grandma's squishy hug or the musk from my boyfriend's (don't freak out) scalp.

    <p><em>Q2：Where is beautiful in Toronto?</em><br>
         A："Snow Pillows in U of T"<br>
         →Get ready - I'm going to teach you how to make a snow pillow...Wait until the dead of winter. Find your way into Hart House library, University of Toronto campus. Exhaust yourself until hopeless, into the night. Wait for fresh snow, and until every sign of life has retreated home. Exit to the Front Campus lawn, pushing through the crispy top layer of untouched snow - the snow will absorb sound, making it sound and feel like you're in an insulating pillow, nothing but lamps lit in the distance. You won't even be cold. Take a deep breath. Now wait, and if you are lucky, the nearby Soldiers' Tower will chime and echo through your snow pillow.

    <p><em>Q3：Who of your friends do you believe is beautiful？And plese introduce her to us!! </em><br>
         A："Abby"<br>
         →Abby and I met during that crushingly awkward pubescent phase, facing the same bullies. I know she has big brown eyes. I know she couldn't get fat if she tried. But the thing is, her beauty is so abstract that I can only attempt some examples...She will chop off all her hair and know she looks good...She will visit you in Japan and get a (colorful and huge) tattoo on her forearm - a paper nautilus riding a thunder storm - and make it classy. Some women may be intelligent and beautiful. Abby is aware and radiant.
