This sub-project, along with the musicians project, was the first idea to pop into my mind. It also reflects on my past year and half, being very TV show-esque (although I must clarify I did nothing whatsoever in the production side while working in the TV industry). There are a bunch of programs on TV or online that introduce basic everyday cuisine or specialties of various countries, so the “food” aspect of this sub-project might not be groundbreaking. However, being a foodie myself, I knew I wanted at least one sub-project centered on daily cuisine, and since the entire <i>World in Twelve</i> relies heavily on the connections between people, the connection between parent and child, grandparent and grandchild seemed like an intriguing choice. Also, although all of my sub-projects are meant to be an “expression of each city”, I noticed that they were all expressions of the present. I didn’t have anything that introduced the change in the city, from era to era, so I wanted to hear stories from the older generation, even if it was just few personal experiences.<br><br>
Also, I've come to realize as I've grown older, that we spend less and less time doing something with our parents and grandparents. I thought it would be cool if this sub-project could be used as a situation to cook something up, and have a nice chat and meal with the family. <br><br>
...so that may be the non-goofiest introduction I’ve written for this entire website. Anyway, details are below. <br><br>
<div id="project-details">
  Goal: To get recipes from different families around the world. There will be the actual pictures of people cooking, eating, and having fun! 
  <br><br>
Also, we'll ask two questions to the family members.<br>
1.How has the city changed since you first started living here? <br>
2.How do you think the city will change in the future? 
<br><br>
  After the “World in Twelve” is finished, we will have recipes from all 12 cities which I will try to make into a book.

It may be the recipe for that special occasion. It might be the recipe she made for her children every morning. Whatever it is, there’s going to be a story behind it. Let’s find out.
