This sub-project, along with the musicians project, was the first idea to pop into my mind. It also reflects on my past year and half, being very TV show-esque (although I must clarify I did nothing whatsoever in the production side while working in the TV industry). There are a bunch of programs on TV or online that introduce basic everyday cuisine or specialties of various countries, so the “food” aspect of this sub-project might not be groundbreaking. However, being a foodie myself, I knew I wanted at least one sub-project centered on daily cuisine, and since the entire “World in Twelve” relies heavily on the connections between people, the connection between grandmother (or grandfather) and grandchild seemed like an intriguing choice. Also, although all of my sub-projects are meant to be an “expression of each city”, I noticed that they were all expressions of the present. I didn’t have anything that introduced the change in the city, from era to era, so I wanted to hear stories from the older generation, even if it was just one personal experience.<br><br>
...so that may be the non-goofiest introduction I’ve written for this entire website. Anyway, details are below. <br><br>
<div id="project-details">
  Goal: To have a grandmother or grandfather teach us one of her/his favorite recipes, and make a meal together with the grandchild. While doing this, we’ll listen to stories from the grandparent about his or her childhood, and how the city has changed since then and over the years.  We may ask a few of the “12 questions” too.<br><br>

  After the “World in Twelve” is finished, I will have recipes from all 12 cities which I will try to make into a book.

It may be the recipe for that special occasion. It might be the recipe she made for her children every morning. Whatever it is, there’s going to be a story behind it. Let’s find out.
