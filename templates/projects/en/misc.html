I’ve spent about one year preparing for the <i>World in Twelve</i>. I’ve hypothesized all the various possibilities that may or may not occur, and done my best gathering all the necessary people, funding, equipment and time. Being the pessimist I am, I don’t think I can ever bring the preparation stage to “perfection” (after all, perfection is all in the mind), but I do believe that by the time I leave Tokyo, I should be at the stage of “prepared enough.” That being said, I know for certain that so many unexpected things will happen during this upcoming year that much of my preparation will be rendered meaningless. I’m going to be living in foreign cities where in many cases I can’t even speak the native language. Of course there are going to be events that occur every day that were completely inconceivable at the initial creation of the <i>World in Twelve</i>.
<br><br>
<em>But that’s the point, right?</em>
<br><br>
What would be the point of living in all these cities and conducting all these projects if everything happens as expected?? That’s why I wanted a project where I could decide on what I’d be doing upon arrival. I will be “expressing my self” through the city as a first time resident. Let me explain.<br><br>
<div id="project-details">
Goal: To conduct a project on the fly. This is the only project where I don’t have anything pre-planned. Everything that I see, feel, and realize through my  stay as a first time resident in that city will become a component of this sub-project. The difference between this sub-project and the blog is, in the blog, I will be writing mostly about events that occur daily, and my thoughts towards those events. In <i>The Miscellaneous</i>, I will be looking for the reasons behind themes I chose as special aspects unique to that city. The sub-project will be mainly conducted through  writing, but it would be cool if I could make some sort of mini-documentary (With the time constraints this isn’t very realistic though.)
<br><br>
Side Note: One really cool idea that Yoshi, one of the engineers gave me was, to have a vote on which theme to choose. In the first week I would choose 3~4 themes and have the viewers vote on which one I should conduct for <i>The Miscellaneous</i>. I would then decide in the following few days. Since all the other sub-projects are decided by yours truly, it would be interesting to have one as the “people’s project.” However, the big problem with this voting process is, there have to be enough users to make this democratic decision hold any meaning. It would be kind of sad if, say, there were only 6 total votes. This makes it extremely difficult to conduct in the first few months when no one knows of the <i>World in Twelve</i> and it has only a few followers.

Anyhow, as with almost every deciding facet in ones’ life, in the end, there’s only one thing one can say. Let’s see what happens.
