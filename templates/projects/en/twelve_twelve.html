There is going to be a project called LIVE, where we’ll be doing some sort of live broadcasting. At least we hope so. This project is going to be BY FAR the most difficult to conduct during a one month stay, due to various factors, so the <i>World in Twelve</i> team is trying to figure out how to make it possible. We’ll be updating this section once we get everything together! We apologize for the inconvenience!!
